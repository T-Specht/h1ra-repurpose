Oral/intranasal H1-antihistamine, decongestants, leukotriene receptor antagonists, intranasal corticosteroids are the pillars in the management of AR.Materials and methods: Seventy patients with allergic rhinitis participated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel, active controlled, comparative 4 week trial. The patients between age group of 18-65 years of either gender having moderate-severe intermittent or mild persistent allergic rhinitis were included. The study inclusion criteria required the subjects with Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) of 5 or higher. The patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups with montelukast-levocetrizine (10 mg and 5 mg) in one group and montelukast-fexofenadine (10 mg and 120 mg) in another group. TNSS parameter was the main effectiveness parameter.	Parallel Assignment	Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla	OTHER	All	65	18	70	Actual	OTHER	Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla	Randomized	\N	Double	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem. It is the cause of major illness and disability worldwide. Estimates indicate that 10-25% of population worldwide is affected by AR. The main symptoms of AR include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itching, sneezing and non-nasal symptoms like burning, itching and watery eyes or itching ears and palate. These symptoms can have a considerable toll on patient's quality of life by interfering with cognitive and emotional functioning. The estimated annual cost attributable to AR in United States ranges from $1.4 billion to nearly $ 6 billion in direct cost annually. Today's antiallergic therapy is based on avoidance of the causative allergen, symptomatic pharmacotherapy, specific immunotherapy and education. Oral/intranasal H1-antihistaminics, decongestants, leukotrienes receptor antagonists, intranasal corticosteroids are the pillars in the management of allergic rhinitis. Second generation antihistamines have become increasingly popular because of their comparable efficacy and lower incidence of adverse effects relative to first generation counterparts. Levocetirizine, a potent second generation histamine (H1) receptor antagonist, is effective against persistent allergic rhinitis and thus improves quality of life and reduces co-morbidities and societal costs. Fexofenadine, is a selective, non sedating, second generation H1 receptor antagonist which have an additional impact on the inflammatory mediators. Monteleukast is a highly selective type I receptor antagonist of leukotriene D4. The leukotrienes modifiers have both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator properties.\n\nThe literature search establishes that addition of an antihistamine to montelukast has added benefit. The combination therapy of montelukast with antihistamine provide enhancing and complimentary effects thereby reducing the symptoms effectively. The results with concomitant levocetirizine and montelukast treatment are better as compared to monotherapy with levocetirizine on symptoms and quality of life in allergic rhinitis. Fexofenadine along with montelukast is more effective than antihistaminic alone in control of allergic rhinitis symptoms. There is literature available for the comparisons of concomitant levocetirizine and montelukast with monotherapy or placebo and comparisons of concomitant fexofenadine and montelukast with monotherapy or placebo. But scanty data is available regarding comparisons of concomitant montelukast-levocetirizine with montelukast-fexofenadine.	2014-04-01	2015-04-01	2015-06-01	2015-09-16	\N	2015-09-16	\N	Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla	DR.MOHINI MAHATME	ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Allergic Rhinitis"}	comparison	fexofenadine	also combination	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{}	CT_RESULTS	\N	fexofenadine|levocetirizine

Assessment will be done using UAS7and OSS as devised by Berroeta et al.\n\nURTICARIA ACTIVITY SCORE Table-2 SCORE WEALS PRURITUS\n\n0 None None\n\n1 Mild (<20 weals / 24 hours) Mild (present but not troublesome)\n\n2 Moderate (20-50 weals / 24 hours) Moderate (troublesome but does not interfere with sleep)\n\n3 Severe (>50 weals / 24 hours) Severe (sufficiently troublesome to interfere with normal daily activity and sleep)\n\nScores of both parameters i.e. number of weals and severity of the pruritus per day are to be added to get UAS of that day and average UAS over 7 days is calculated which will range between 0 to 6. Patients will be instructed to write down number of weals and severity of itching in their daily urticaria diary. UAS7 will be calculated every fortnightly by calculating average of weal and itch score of the previous seven days after taking detailed history from patient.\n\nUAS7 SCORES71 HEALTH STATE\n\n0 Urticaria free\n\n1-6 Well controlled urticaria\n\n7-15 Mild urticaria\n\n16-27 Moderate urticaria\n\n26-42 Severe urticaria\n\nOUTCOME SCORING SCALE Another assessment scale i.e.Outcome scoring scale devised by Berroeta et al 22 for cyclosporine and azathioprine treatment of CU will also be used for clinical assessment of subjects.\n\n1- No change 2 - Minimal improvement (no change in frequency or extent, symptomatic improvement ±) 3- Moderate improvement (less frequent or extensive, symptomatic improvement +) 4- Marked improvement (occasional episodes and less extensive, symptomatic improvement ++) 5- Clearance\n\nIn addition, ASST , APST and IgE levels will be done before starting cyclosporine and azathioprine and at the completion of the treatment after three months.\n\nFOLLOW UP After completion of oral cyclosporine and oral azathioprine for three months, patients will be followed up for a period of three more months, every fortnightly in urticaria clinic. At each visit, clinical assessment will be done using UAS7 and OSS. Urticaria being a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, will relapse immediately as soon as the treatment is withheld. So, a follow up period of three months will be sufficient enough to study the effect of cyclosporine and azathioprine on long term remission of urticaria. Patients developing angioedema and having uncontrolled excessive exacerbation during treatment will be removed from study and will be treated accordingly.\n\nPatients who will fail to take the treatment for ≥ one week will be defined as defaulters and removed from the study. Those with no improvement even after one month of regular treatment will be labelled as non responders.	2016-12-06	2017-11-01	2017-11-01	2017-08-15	\N	2018-01-11	\N	Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research	Davinder Parsad	DParsad(professor)	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 1","Phase 2"}	{"Chronic Refractory Urticaria"}	not included	levocetirizine	Other name for treatment is levocetirzine but that does not make any sense in this context	f	Urticaria	2022-09-15 18:58:14	{}	UNKNOWN	\N	levocetirizine

Do Furanocoumarins Mediate the Fexofenadine-grapefruit Juice Interaction?	Completed	Purpose: Grapefruit juice is one of the most extensively studied dietary/natural substances shown to interact with a variety of medications. However, unanswered questions remain regarding the causative ingredients and mechanisms underlying such drug-grapefruit juice interactions. Compounds in grapefruit juice called furanocoumarins have been established as major causative ingredients, which act by inhibiting the elimination (metabolism) of drugs, leading to increased circulating drug concentrations. Increased drug concentrations can in turn lead to increased drug potency or even toxicity. Grapefruit juice also has been shown, paradoxically, to decrease circulating concentrations of some drugs, including the non-sedating antihistamine agent, fexofenadine (Allegra), which undergoes negligible metabolism. Whether or not furanocoumarins mediate the decrease in fexofenadine concentrations is unknown. The purpose of the proposed study is to compare the effects of a "furanocoumarin-free" grapefruit juice with grapefruit juice on circulating concentrations of fexofenadine.

Vitamin D is well known to be an important vitamin for the development and maintenance of bones. Recently, scientists have learned that vitamin D may have a role in the prevention of cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. The investigators are specifically interested in studying this question in the overweight/obese population as they are at greater risk for both vitamin D deficiency and impaired ability to metabolize sugar (glucose intolerance).\n\nPrimary Hypotheses:\n\nVitamin D repletion (increasing the serum 25(OH)D level from ≤ 20 ng/ml to ≥ 30 ng/ml) will improve insulin sensitivity in individuals who are overweight/obese and insulin resistant.\n\nSecondary Hypotheses:\n\n1.Vitamin D repletion will improve biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and inflammation (directly altering macrophage cytokine production and/or indirectly as a result of improvement in insulin sensitivity.) 2.30,000 IU (0.25 mg) weekly of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) will raise serum 25(OH)D levels from ≤ 20 ng/ml to ≥ 30 ng/ml overweight/obese population.

(2015) American Journal of Kidney Diseases 65(4):574-582). In this study, patients were studied directly before routine dialysis treatment. Other published literature suggests the timing of the dose of some drugs (before or after dialysis) may have a profound impact on the drug pharmacokinetics (Nolin et al (2006) 17(9):2363-7). The hypothesis is that compounds that accumulate in the blood of patients with kidney failure impact the pharmacokinetics such that dosing before or after dialysis produces significantly different blood levels of the drug.

At the first study visit, the patient will be randomized to receive the drug fexofenadine (120 mg, orally) either 3 hour prior to, OR at the conclusion of their regularly scheduled dialysis treatment. Three hours following fexofenadine administration, a single 4 mL (approximately 1 teaspoon) blood sample will be drawn. One week or more after the first study day, the patient will have the study repeated but with the timing of the dose altered to match the randomization. For example, if at the first study visit the patient received fexofenadine after their dialysis session, they will now receive the drug 3 hours prior to their dialysis session.

Third generation antihistamines have been demonstrated effective in the treatment of this condition. Allergen challenge can be use to assess the effects of drugs in allergic rhinitis, adenosine monophosphate may also be used as a means to investigate these effects but as yet its effects have yet to be compared to allergen challenge. We intend to compare the effects of levocetirizine at a single dose of 5mg on allergen and AMP challenge compared to placebo in a double blind cross-over study. The study will include 20 patients with allergic rhinitis. Each patient will have allergen and AMP challenge on placebo and active treatment. The primary outcome variable will be the change in concentration of AMP/Allergen required to produce a 20% drop in nasal flow as manifest by peak nasal inspiratory flow. A 1 doubling dose change in concentration of challenge medium to cause a 20% drop in nasal flow will be deemed significant. We will also measure time to recovery after both challenges. AMP challenge is a safe alternative to allergen challenge and does not have the risk of anaphylaxis.

Rhinitis and asthma frequently coexist, and large-scale population surveys indicate that up to 38% of subjects with rhinitis have asthma, and up to 78% of subjects with asthma have chronic nasal symptoms. Safety concerns with the increased use of inhaled corticosteroids, the heterogeneity of the disease, and poor compliance with asthma medication regimens, point to the need for the development of safe and convenient oral therapies for asthma. Histamine is an important chemical mediator of inflammation in asthma. The benefits of antihistamine treatment in patients with mild to moderate asthma have been well documented, however their clinical use has been previously limited due to the high doses required for efficacy and their associated side effects including sedation and cognitive impairment.	2002-03-01	2003-10-01	2003-10-01	2002-09-17	\N	2008-08-21	\N	\N	\N	\N	ICD Study Director	sanofi-aventis	\N	\N	Interventional	{Child,Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 3"}	{Asthma}	main	fexofenadine	Repurpose?

Birch pollen is one important allergen driving allergic conjunctivitis and rhinitis. The characteristics and location IgE producing cells in the nose and their contribution to the subsequent increase in allergen-specific IgE levels in the serum have so far poorly been investigated. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for the development of new therapeutic approaches and is thus the aim of the proposed study. Thus, the investigators plan to conduct a two-armed study of a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind nasal allergen provocation where 30 patients will be provoked with birch pollen extract (n=20) or placebo (n=10) out of the birch pollen season (October) and follow them closely for up to 4 months. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the localization and characteristics of IgE producing cells in the nasal mucosa contributing to the allergen-induced boosts of specific serum IgE upon natural and controlled nasal allergen exposure.	Parallel Assignment	Medical University of Vienna	OTHER	All	60	18	30	Anticipated	OTHER	Medical University of Vienna	Randomized	\N	Triple	\N	\N	Basic Science	\N	The nose represents an important and first site of allergen contact, both because it is the organ most frequently affected by allergic symptoms and also because it plays an important role for the regulation of IgE production and allergic inflammation. The nasal mucosa acts as a barrier against intruding allergens. This barrier function can be perturbed by various factors such as cigarette smoke, rhinovirus infection or interferon-γ. Exposure to these factors may lead to increased allergen penetration. Nasal allergen contact in sensitized subjects leads to allergic nasal inflammation and symptoms. The investigators of this study have previously demonstrated that allergen-specific IgE levels in sensitized individuals are strongly boosted upon nasal allergen contact during the relevant allergen season or in well controlled intranasal allergen challenge models. This allergen-induced rise in IgE levels consequently leads to increased sensitivity of allergic patients in terms of IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil activation as well as IgE-facilitated antigen presentation via the high (FcεRI) or low (CD23) affinity receptor for IgE by antigen presenting cells, to T cells. In this context, the investigators have recently shown that not only allergen-specific IgE levels themselves but also the crosslinking ability of complexes formed between IgE and allergen dictate the extent of CD23-mediated T cell activation.\n\nThe observation that nasal allergen contact triggers boosting of systemic allergen-specific IgE levels indicates the presence of IgE+ producing cells locally in the nasal mucosa which can be stimulated upon allergen contact. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations: (A) there is an evidence that IgE-producing B cells and plasma cells are present in the nasal mucosa but nothing has been proven yet. (B) Upon ex vivo challenge of biopsies from nasal mucosa of allergic patients, local synthesis not only of ε germline, but also of ε circle transcripts as products of mature IgE synthesis were observed. However, to which extent this local nasal IgE production contributes to the observed systemic boost of IgE and the underlying kinetics of IgE production are so far unknown and are one important aim of this proposal.\n\nAlso, though local IgE production has been observed, the presence of the IgE producing cells themselves in the nasal mucosa has so far not been confirmed. One important reason for this is the difficulty of unambiguously identifying those cells by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. In the past several step by step flow cytometry protocols have been developed with the aim of excluding non-relevant cells prior to gating for IgE+ B cells. However, it needs to be borne in mind that all currently used anti-IgE antibodies recognize not only surface IgE present in the form of the B cell receptor but also bound to CD23. As a consequence, most current studies overestimate the presence of IgE B cell receptor (BCR) bearing B cells. This has only recently been demonstrated in a study by Jimenez-Saiz et al. where the authors found that only around 0.0015% of B cells bear an IgE BCR. Here the authors employed a single cell nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to validate the nature of the BCR after flow cytometry-based cell sorting for IgE+ B cells using previously reported protocols. The overestimation is most likely due to detection of IgE+ B cells bearing CD23 bound IgE. One option to improve flow cytometric detection could be to exclude CD23 positive cells but this could also lead to exclusion of IgE producing cells expressing CD23. Thus, the only alternative to overcome this obstacle is to use an anti-IgE antibody that can distinguish between receptor bound and membrane anchored IgE. In this respect, an anti-IgE antibody fulfilling these requirements has recently been shown to successfully identify IgE producing cells. Thus, the investigators will employ this novel strategy to identify IgE producing cells both in the nasal mucosa as well as in the blood of allergic subjects.\n\nIn this project, the investigators aim to elucidate the sites and characteristics of allergen-specific IgE production in a two-armed study spanning birch pollen allergic subject undergoing controlled nasal birch pollen challenge outside the season (October). To that aim, IgE producing cells in blood will be determined using flow cytometry and IgE producing cells in the nasal mucosa will be revealed in nasal biopsies using confocal microscopy. Understanding the characteristics and locations of IgE producing cells is critical for the development of future new therapeutic approaches.	2021-11-11	2025-01-01	2026-09-01	2021-09-13	\N	2022-08-24	\N	Medical University of Vienna	Sven Schneider, MD	Principal Investigator	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Not Applicable"}	{Allergy}	rescue medication	desloratadine	\N	f	Allergy	2022-09-15 19:16:20	{"Gangl K, Reininger R, Bernhard D, Campana R, Pree I, Reisinger J, Kneidinger M, Kundi M, Dolznig H, Thurnher D, Valent P, Chen KW, Vrtala S, Spitzauer S, Valenta R, Niederberger V.

It is hypothesized that FPNS provides greater nasal symptom relief than cetirizine. The primary measure used to test this hypothesis is the change from baseline over two weeks in reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) compared between FPNS and cetirizine. Approximately 648 subjects will be randomized into a 1:1:1:1 ratio of treatment allocation across approximately twenty-five to thirty-five sites in the US during the 2013 fall allergy season. All subjects will be outpatients. The total duration of study will be approximately 21 days including 7 days of screening period, and 14 days of treatment period.

Certain T cells (types of white blood cells) called Th2 cells produce substances that generate allergies. Other T cells called Th1 cells produce substances that have opposite effects. This study will determine if allergy shots change the immune response to allergens by reducing the number of Th2 cells or by changing them into Th1 cells. A better understanding of how this treatment works may help scientists develop more effective allergy therapies.\n\nPeople between 18 and 50 years of age who have had allergic asthma for at least 1 year may participate in this study. Candidates' medical, allergy and medication histories will be reviewed, and they will have a physical examination, including routine blood tests, urinalysis, electrocardiogram (EKG), and lung function test. Blood will also be drawn to test T cell response to allergens, and 12 skin tests (similar to a tuberculosis skin test) will be done to test for sensitivity to various allergens.\n\nParticipants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for 1 to 2 days for rush therapy (see below). They will have a brief history and physical examination. A heparin lock (thin plastic tube similar to an intravenous line) will be placed in an arm vein. They will then undergo the following procedures:\n\nRush/Cluster Immunotherapy - An allergen is given in increasing doses over 2 to 5 weeks. During rush therapy, the dose is increased rapidly over 1 to 2 days until a moderate level dose is reached. To reduce the chance of an allergic reaction, patients take prednisone, cetirizine (Zyrtec® (Registered Trademark)), ranitidine (Zantac® (Registered Trademark)) and montelukast (Singular® (Registered Trademark)) starting 24 hours before treatment begins until rush therapy ends. After discharge on the third day, patients return to the clinic once a week for the next 2 to 5 weeks for cluster therapy, in which the dose is increased more gradually to a maintenance level.\nMaintenance Immunotherapy - Participants receive 12 weekly injections at the maintenance dose. Blood is drawn during one visit between weeks 2 and 7 of maintenance therapy.\nFollow-up Visits - Patients return to the clinic 2 and 3 weeks after the last maintenance dose for blood draws and evaluations. In addition, a "late-phase" allergen skin test is done at the 3-week follow-up to compare reaction results with those from the test done at the screening visit.\nEnd-of-Study Visit - 12 to 16 weeks after the last allergy shot, patients return for a final blood draw and brief evaluation.	\N	National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)	NIH	All	\N	\N	50	\N	NIH	National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Asthma is a major public health problem due to its high prevalence and significant impact on activities of daily living. Allergen immunotherapy or vaccination consists of the therapeutic administration of allergen extract. The efficacy of allergen immunotherapy in asthma is modest, however immunotherapy remains the only known disease modifying therapy for allergic asthma. Because the exact mechanism through which immunotherapy works is unclear, a greater understanding of the mechanism of action of allergen immunotherapy is needed before modern immunopharmacologic methods can be applied to increase its therapeutic efficacy. This goal of the study is to determine the effects of allergen immunotherapy on allergen specific T cell responses. This is an open label study in which allergen specific CD4+T lymphocyte responses will be monitored before, during and after 12 weekly injections of maintenance immunotherapy, allowing the study of both the induction as well as decay of these changes. Immunotherapy will be employed in a rush/cluster schedule consisting of the serial administration of rapidly increasing doses of allergen delivered subcutaneously over a 2 day period (rush), followed by more gradually increasing weekly injections over 2-6 weeks (cluster), during which time the subject is brought to a maintenance allergen dose, which will then be repeatedly administered on a weekly basis. Immunological endpoints will consist of the frequency and cytokine profile of allergen specific T cell responses as measured by intracellular cytokine staining and the measurement of in vitro induced T cell cytokines by real time RT-PCR. Ten allergic asthmatic subjects will be enrolled in the therapeutic arm of the study.	1999-07-01	\N	2003-08-01	1999-11-04	\N	2008-03-04	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Observational	{Child,Adult,"Older Adult"}	{}	{Asthma,Hypersensitivity}	minimal	cetirizine	To reduce the chance of an allergic reaction, patients take prednisone, cetirizine (Zyrtec® (Registered Trademark)), ranitidine (Zantac® (Registered Trademark)) and montelukast (Singular® (Registered Trademark)) starting 24 hours before treatment begins until rush therapy ends	f	Allergy	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Creticos PS, Reed CE, Norman PS, Khoury J, Adkinson NF Jr, Buncher CR, Busse WW, Bush RK, Gadde J, Li JT, et al.

Therefore, it is important and necessary to understand and visualize therapy effects on this disease. In this study we will demonstrate the effect of levocetirizine on nasal cavity dimensions by assessing not only standard nasal flow diagnostics such as rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry, but supplement exami¬nation procedures with long-term rhinometry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With the aid of a virtual model and computer fluid dynamics, we are able to simulate nasal air flow and provide three-dimensional visualization of the computed flow.\n\nIn previous trials ([Bachert], [deBlic], [Day] and [Deruaz]) it has been shown that allergic symptoms, especially nasal congestion, diminish significantly under treatment with levocetirizine. We will demonstrate this anti-obstructive effect by comparing the reaction to nasal allergen challenge before and after four-week treatment with levocetirizine.

Multicentric Controlled Randomized Study in Cross-over, Double-blind	Tranexamic Acid and Spontaneous Chronic Urticaria	Recruiting	Spontaneous chronic urticaria (UCS) is a disease that affects 1% of the general population with a potentially severe impact on quality of life. Most patients respond favorably to long-term antihistamine treatment, but sometimes it is necessary to give a high dose (4 times the formal dose, Berlin consensus 2016). These high doses are often accompanied by side effects requiring cessation of treatment. The therapeutic alternative is then omalizumab, an expensive biotherapy. UCS is secondary to non-specific mast cell activation. It has been shown to be associated with activation of fibrinolysis that correlates with the severity of symptoms. Patients with UCS resistant to levocetirizine were shown to have higher D-dimer levels than patients who responded to antihistamines. Tranexamic acid is a molecule with antifibrinolytic propertiesSeveral cases of severe chronic urticaria responding favorably to treatment with tranexamic acid have been reported. In our department, Investigators also noticed the improvement of some of their patients on tranexamic acid. The combination of these two treatments appears to be synergistic: action on histamine receptors and control of fibrinolysis.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate the association of tranexamic acid and levocetirizine for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria.

The extent of the arterial deoxygenation may be influenced by a histamine-mediated inflammatory response at the pulmonary capillary-alveolar membrane limiting oxygen diffusion. Moreover, while EIAH has been routinely explored in running and cycling, swimming is understudied despite potential mechanistic avenues which may put swimmers at further risk for EIAH. The purpose of this study is threefold: 1) to determine whether highly-trained swimmers experience EIAH during submaximal and maximal exercise, 2) to determine the extent to which histamine release influences oxyhemoglobin saturation during swimming exercise, and 3) to determine whether nedocromil sodium (NS), a mast cell stabilizer, and cetirizine HCl (CH), an H1-receptor competitive inhibitor, can improve oxyhemoglobin saturation during submaximal and maximal swimming exercise. Twenty-six (13 men, 13 women) highly-trained swimmers will complete an intense swimming protocol to assess the histamine response to intense exercise. A subset with the highest histamine responses will participate in three additional sessions (placebo, NS, and CH conditions) which will include a swimming aerobic capacity test and 5-minutes of swimming at both 70 and 85% of their maximal oxygen uptake.	Crossover Assignment	Indiana University	OTHER	All	35	18	26	Anticipated	OTHER	Indiana University	Non-Randomized	\N	Double	\N	\N	Basic Science	\N	For the first testing session, participants will report to the Indiana University Human Performance Laboratory to complete a medical screening and, if willing, consent to the procedures of the study. The medical screening will include measurements of height, weight, resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, and resting pulmonary function along with a health history questionnaire.\n\nThe second testing session consists of an assessment of risk factors for development of EIAH, specifically changes in blood biomarkers pre- and post-swimming exercise. Participants will report to the Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatics Center and complete an exercise protocol designed to elicit an inflammatory response. Venous blood draws will be performed to assess participants' pre-exercise complete blood count and pre- and post-intense exercise concentrations of plasma IL-1β, IL-8, plasma histamine, whole blood histamine, and histamine release. Measurements of hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit will also be performed pre- and post-exercise in order to correct biomarker concentrations for fluid loss during exercise. Swimmers of each sex that exhibit the largest histamine release will be selected for further study until at least four swimmers of each sex complete all three experimental trials.\n\nParticipants that exhibit increases in inflammatory markers following swimming exercise will visit the Human Performance Laboratory on three occasions separated by at least 48 hours and no more than 60 days. Apart from receiving a placebo (PL) or different drug treatment (nedocromil sodium, NS; cetirizine HCl, CH) prior to exercise, participants will perform identical protocols on each visit to the laboratory. Participants will report to the lab and consume either a placebo or CH pill, followed by a health history update questionnaire and their resting pulmonary function will be measured. Participants will then complete a self-selected warm-up that will be standardized across all three testing sessions, followed by administration of either a placebo or NS through an inhaler and instrumentation. The exercise protocol beings with a progressive swimming test to maximum aerobic capacity (V̇O2max) in a swimming flume, followed by two constant load work bouts at approximately 70 and 85% of the previously recorded HRmax while peripheral capillary oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) is continuously monitored. Participants will receive a 20-min break between each work bout. Drug treatments will be assigned in a double-blind, randomized crossover fashion such that each participant receives each treatment. Concentrations of plasma histamine, whole blood histamine, and histamine release will be assessed from pre- and post-exercise blood samples.	2021-05-19	2022-12-31	2022-12-31	2021-10-27	\N	2022-02-02	\N	Indiana University	Robert Chapman	Principal Investigator	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Exercise-induced Arterial Hypoxemia"}	combination	cetirizine	\N	t	Exercise-induced Arterial Hypoxemia	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Coyle MA, Goss CS, Manz WJ, Greenshields JT, Chapman RF, Stager JM.

If levothyroxine does affect the metabolism of other drugs, the dose of those medications may need to be increased to enhance their action or decreased to avoid adverse reactions.\n\nPatients 18 years of age and older with thyroid cancer who are participating in NIH protocol #77-DK-0096 and are receiving long-term suppression therapy with levothyroxine may be eligible for this study. This is not a study of thyroid cancer or of potential new drugs to treat it. Thyroid cancer patients are being studied because their treatment regimen provides an opportunity to study drug metabolism while patients are both on and off levothyroxine therapy.\n\nParticipants come to the NIH Clinical Center on two occasions: once while they are regularly taking their levothyroxine, and once while they are off the medication in preparation for their radioactive iodide diagnostic scan for the procedures outlined below. The time interval between the two clinic visits depends on whether the first visit is while the patient is on or off medication. Participants are asked to fast overnight before each visit and to abstain from certain foods and beverages for 48 to 72 hours before the visit. At each visit, patients undergo the following procedures:\n\nMedication history, limited physical examination, and blood draw for laboratory tests, including a test to look for genes important in eliminating medications from the body.\nInsertion of a catheter (thin plastic tube) into an arm vein for collecting blood samples.\nShave skin biopsy (optional) to explore how proteins in the skin that metabolize and transport drugs are affected by thyroid hormone. For this procedure, the skin is cleaned, numbed with medicine, and a small sample of the top layer is removed with a razor blade. The wound heals in 2 to 3 days.\nMedication dosing. Participants take all of the following substances by mouth at the same time: 1) 200 mg of caffeine, a compound commonly found in chocolate, soda/pop, coffee, tea and non-prescription products to prevent sleep; 2) 30 mg of dextromethorphan, a non-prescription cough suppressant; 3) 40 mg of omeprazole, a prescription drug for heartburn and stomach ulcers; 4) 8 mg of midazolam, a prescription drug used to cause relaxation and drowsiness; and 5) 120 mg of fexofenadine, a non-sedating prescription antihistamine used to treat allergies.\nBlood and urine sampling. Fifteen blood samples of about 5 mL (1 teaspoon) each are collected through the catheter and urine is collected over the next 24 hours to determine what happens to the test drugs in the body.\n\nParticipants may resume their normal diet 4 hours after taking the study medications.	\N	National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)	NIH	All	\N	\N	20	\N	NIH	National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	Interaction between thyroid hormones and commonly prescribed drugs has been well documented, resulting in augmentation or attenuation of the action of either compound. Phase I drug metabolism is mediated mostly by enzymes belonging to the cytochrome p450 superfamily. Studies in animals and cell cultures have shown that thyroid hormones play an important role in the constitutive expression of the p450 enzymes, thus potentially altering the metabolism and the effects of a variety of drugs. P-glycoprotein is expressed in the major organs associated with drug absorption, distribution, and elimination from the body (e.g. intestine, kidney, liver, skin, and the blood-brain barrier). Expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein in humans also appears to be influenced by thyroid hormones. We intend to study the effect of thyroid hormones on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein by using a five-drug cocktail (caffeine, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam, and fexofenadine) administered in patients with thyroid cancer, both on thyroid hormone suppression therapy (in conditions of subclinical hyperthyroidism) and off this treatment (in conditions of hypothyroidism) at the time of their routine radioactive iodine scan. Additionally we will perform two skin biopsies in order to assess the pattern of expression of metabolic enzymes and drug transport proteins on and off thyroid hormone suppression therapy.	2004-04-01	\N	2005-11-01	2004-04-07	\N	2008-03-04	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Interventional	{Child,Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 2"}	{"Thyroid Cancer"}	minimal	fexofenadine	usecase of fex is a probing substance	f	Pharmacokinetics	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{"Meisel C, Gerloff T, Kirchheiner J, Mrozikiewicz PM, Niewinski P, Brockmoller J, Roots I.

None (Open Label)	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	Fexofenadine Hydrochloride Topical Lotion 1% (OP2101) is a novel patented formulation developed for the treatment of skin disorders characterized by pruritus. Research show that oral Fexofenadine Hydrochloride (FX) may lead to a small improvement of pruritus in patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). In clinical practice, oral antihistamines are widely used off-label for pruritus relief in AD, indicating a discrepancy in trial outcomes and real-life experience. The pre-study thesis postulates that the antipruritic effect of FX can be leveraged in a dose-response relationship facilitated by high topical concentration of FX in direct contact with the pathological process of the skin. The sponsor also suggest that the Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) blocking property of FX is an untapped resource that is likely to be dose-response dependent and manifested by means of high topical concentration in proximity to the inflammatory process. The repositioning of FX to a topical treatment has the potential for high safety, efficacy, fast relief, and ease of use. OP2101 is also aimed at inflammation control, suppression of bacterial imbalance, moisture retention, upregulation of antimicrobial peptides, and skin barrier restoration. As such, it targets six of the pathological pillars of AD. Assessment of topical tolerability and skin adsorption (systemic exposure) are the main objectives in this phase 1 study.	2022-04-01	2022-10-16	2022-10-16	2022-07-18	\N	2022-11-02	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 1"}	{"Atopic Dermatitis","Atopic Dermatitis Eczema","Atopic Rash",Rash,Pruritus,Urticaria,"Urticaria Chronic",Psoriasis,"Psoriasis Vulgaris","Skin Rash","Skin Inflammation",Eczema}	main	fexofenadine	\N	f	Eczema	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	fexofenadine

In 30-40% of patients metastasis is confined to the liver. In these patients R0-resection of metastases may contribute to marked improvement of overall survival. Primary resection of liver metastasis is possible in about 15-20% of patients (Scheele 2005, Petrelli 2005). Recent studies indicate that perioperative chemotherapy may improve survival after resection of liver metastases (Portier 2007, Nordlinger 2007). Nevertheless, there is evidence that 70-80% of patients have recurrent disease after resection of liver metastasis. Stratification for the risk of recurrence may be performed using the FONG-score (Fong 1999).\n\nThis study is designed to investigate the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR treatment using panitumumab.\n\nThe majority of patients present to the surgeon after chemotherapeutic pretreatment with various not necessarily standardized regimens. Also postoperative therapy after resection of liver metastasis is not a clearly defined standard of care in Germany.\n\nBased on the study by Nordlinger et al. an oxaliplatin-based regimen is chosen for postoperative therapy (Nordlinger 2008). For reasons of practicability mFOLFOX6 was selected as the chemotherapy backbone for additive treatment (Allegra 2010).\n\nAlso, there is evidence that the combination of FOLFOX with panitumumab is associated with enhanced antitumor activity (Douillard et al. ESMO 2009). The experimental treatment arm will therefore evaluate the combination of FOLFOX plus panitumumab. Since in colorectal cancer monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR are not active in KRAS mutant patients, the experimental arm including panitumumab will only be performed in KRAS wild-type patients (Amado 2008).\n\nThe planned study aims to assess the efficacy of postoperative therapy with FOLFOX plus panitumumab followed by maintenance with panitumumab for 3 months in KRAS wild-type patients, compared to the historical data for standard FOLFOX chemotherapy alone, which are verified by a randomised control group without the antibody. (Figure 1: Study Design).\n\nThe study will allow preoperative treatment with regimens such as FOLFIRI, XELIRI, FOLFOX or XELOX +/-bevacizumab or +/- cetuximab. However, only those patients will be considered eligible who did not progress during preoperative therapy.\n\nAfter surgery, a treatment-free interval of at least 4 weeks, but no longer than 8 weeks will be granted.\n\nKRAS-wild-type patients (60% of all pts) will then be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to an experimental arm with FOLFOX + panitumumab or to a reference arm with FOLFOX alone. Combination treatment will be performed for a duration of 3 months, after which patients in the experimental arm will receive maintenance therapy with panitumumab for further 3 months. In the reference arm, treatment will, however, be ended after 3 months.	Parallel Assignment	PD Dr. med.

In more than half of the cases, it lasts more than 2 years. It can dramatically alter the quality of life, in particular sleep, and generates numerous consultations and hospitalizations, with an average annual cost per patient close to 2000 euros in Europe. The treatment is based on the validated 2nd generation anti-H1 antihistamines dosage of one tablet per day whose effectiveness is satisfactory, however about half the time. In cases of severe CSU refractory to treatment with anti-H1 licensed dosage, few therapeutic alternatives exist, still off-label: the monketulast, an anti-leukotriene, ciclosporine or methotrexate, as immunosuppressants. Various studies have shown the important benefit of an expensive anti-IgE biological: the omaluzimab. Several open studies have also suggested superior efficacy and good tolerability of anti-H1 in higher dosage (double, triple or quadruple) including levocetirizine.\n\nThe off-label use of these high dosages of anti-H1 is growing very rapidly in France, tending to replace the use of anti-H1 first generation or substitution to another 2nd generation anti-H1 recommended by the French Society of Dermatology.\n\nThis study, under the aegis of the Urticaria Group of the French Society of Dermatology, intends to compare the efficacy of levocetirizine 4 tablets/day versus 1 tablet/day in the treatment of CSU resistant to anti-H1 licensed dosage.

Patients are monitored with psychiatric rating scales and blood samples at baseline (-1 month) and every four months. The evaluations at baseline, eight and 16 months also encompass collection of CSF (lumbar puncture), psychologic testing and extended blood samples.	Quadruple	The nurse(s) administering Rituximab or placebo (NaCl) infusions will be prevented from having insight into which of the infusions she/he is administering.	\N	Treatment	\N	METHODOLOGY:\n\nThis study is planned as a placebo-controlled, interventional study of parallel groups with 40 participants. Patients will be randomized to either treatment-first arm with 500 mg Rituximab i.v. (infusion 1) at 0 and again at 4 months (infusion 2), or placebo-first arm, receiving NaCl-infusion at 0 and at 4 months. Main evaluation will take place at eight months. The study arms are switched after eight months, i.e. patients starting in the treatment-first arm will receive placebo (NaCl) infusions at 8 months (infusion 3) and 12 months (infusion 4), and patients in the placebo-first arm receive 500 mg-Rituximab infusions at these time points. Final evaluation is scheduled at 16 months. Before each infusion, all patients in the Rituximab and control groups are pre-treated with injection Solu-Medrol 125 mg, i.v., tablet Paracetamol 1000 mg, p.o. and tablet Cetirizin 10 mg, orally.\n\nPatients will be monitored with psychiatric rating scales and blood samples at baseline and every four months. In addition, baseline (-1 months), main (8 months) and final evaluation (16 months) will encompass collection of CSF (lumbar puncture), psychologic testing and extended blood samples. Patient, nurse administering treatment and symptom evaluators are blinded to group randomization.\n\nINVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSAGE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:\n\nTreatment: Rituximab (Roche), 500 mg, dissolved in 250 ml NaCl 9 mg/ml, administered intravenously twice with 4 months interval.\nPlacebo: 250 ml NaCl 9 mg/ml, administered intravenously twice with 4 months interval.\n\nDuration of treatment:\n\nPatients are observed over the course of 16 months. Main evaluation is conducted after 8 months. Participants are randomized to either treatment-first (Rituximab infusion at 0 months and 4 months) or placebo-first (Rituximab infusion at 8 months and 12 months).\n\nSITE MONITORING AND SOURCE DATA VERIFICATION\n\nThe Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, review and regulatory inspection(s), providing access to source data/hospital records. Sponsor verifies that each patient has consented in writing to direct access to the original source data/hospital records by the use of written patient information and signed Informed Consent.\n\nIn accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), monitoring of the study will be arranged by the Sponsor. During the study, the Monitor will have regular contacts with the study site(s), including visits to ensure that the study is conducted and documented properly in compliance with the protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nPrior to the start of the study, the monitor will review the protocol and CRFs with the investigator and his/her staff. The investigator will be visited by the monitor, who will check study procedures, including safety assessments, study medication handling, and data recording.\n\nTo assure the accuracy and completeness of the data recorded in the trial, the monitor will compare Case Report Forms (CRFs) with medical records and other relevant documentation during the on-site monitoring visits (source data verification, SDV). The monitor will have direct access to all source data according to International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) GCP. Incorrect or missing entries into the CRFs will be queried and must be corrected. Any discrepancies of data will be documented and explained in the monitoring reports. Study monitoring will not jeopardize patient confidentiality.\n\nThe study center may also be subject to inspection by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA). The Investigator and other responsible personnel must be available during the monitoring visits and a possible inspection, and should devote sufficient time to these processes.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT\n\nData management and handling of data will be conducted according to the study specific Data Management Plan with ICH guidelines and an assigned CRO's standard operating procedures (SOPs). An electronic CRF (eCRF) system will be used to capture data from the study. Data entry will be performed by the study site personnel. Validation and data queries will be handled by the CRO's Data Management Team. The data will be subjected to validation according to the CRO's SOPs in order to ensure accuracy in the collected CRF data.The CRF will have an audit trail with appropriate functionality for data capture, tracking and documentation of any queries or changes. Electronic signatures will be used to lock the data and identify the person entering or changing the data.\n\nBefore database closure a reconciliation will be performed between the Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) entered in the safety database and the study database. After database closure, the database will be exported as Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) data sets. Any discrepancies and additions from the process defined in the Data Management Plan, will be described in a study specific Data Management Report.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nThe trial comprises a fully blinded randomized part, up to and including the 8 month visit, and a follow-up part, with preserved blinding but where it is known that the patient has received Rituximab treatment either in the fully blinded part of the trial or in the follow-up part. The main treatment comparisons will be based on the fully blinded 8 months of the trial, analyzed as a parallel group trial as described below. Data from the follow-up part will be presented descriptively and will be used for explorative modelling of treatment response and duration.\n\nANALYSIS POPULATION:\n\nThe full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients that received at least one dose of investigational treatment, and will be used for all analyses unless specified. The number of patients with available data for each outcome analysis will be tabulated. In baseline-adjusted analyses, patients that lack baseline data will be excluded.\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:\n\nBrief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score over time, for both parts of the trial, will be described using time series plots of individual data and randomized treatment arm mean values. BPRS and BPRS linear change from baseline at each time point will be described by randomized treatment using dot plots, scatter plots with baseline value on the x-axis, and tables of mean, standard deviation, median, min, max and quartiles.\n\nPRIMARY ANALYSIS:\n\nThe primary outcome, BPRS at 8 months, will primarily be analyzed using a linear model with randomized treatment and baseline BPRS as covariates, and presented as the mean difference between the treatment groups with 95% confidence interval (CI) and two-sided p-value. Primarily the analysis will be based on observed cases, which gives unbiased estimation under a mechanism with random missingness conditional on baseline BPRS and treatment arm.\n\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSES:\n\nTo address missing data,\n\nprimary analysis with missing 8-month values imputed by the 4-month value when available, and the baseline value otherwise. Under a scenario of no increase in BPRS over time and drop-out mainly due to lack of effect, this analysis would be biased against superiority of the Rituximab treatment.\nanalyses of a continuum of scenarios based on a model assuming a treatment group dependent missingness propensity estimated from the observed frequencies, and a treatment group dependent difference in baseline-adjusted mean BPRS between observed and missing outcomes. The results will be presented as contour plots of point estimates, lower and upper 95% CI limits, and 2-sided p-values, for each pair of treatment arm specific differences between observed and missing outcomes. The results will indicate what mean deviations from missing at random conditional on treatment and baseline BPRS would be necessary to affect the conclusions.\nTo address model misspecification, supplemental comparison of linear change in BPRS from baseline between treatment groups using the using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test and the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of location change with 95% confidence interval. In addition, model assumptions will be assessed by residual plots. Deviations from assumptions are not assumed to increase the Type I error, but may affect the interpretation of the estimated treatment contrast.\nTo address non-adherence and protocol deviations, supplemental analysis using the primary model, for patients with two doses of treatment and no major protocol deviations up to 8 months, as determined at data base lock before unblinding.\n\nBPRS at four months will be analyzed using the same method as for the primary time point, including sensitivity analyses. The main purpose of the four-month measurement is exploration of time to response.\n\nSECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES:\n\nAll analyses will be performed without formal multiplicity adjustment, for observed cases.\n\nCGI-S over time will be presented by individual time series plots, and for each visit by number and percentage of patients in each category, and of patients satisfying the criteria for response (at least 2-point reduction from baseline), partial response (a 1 point reduction from baseline), and remission (CGI-S score 1-3). The categorical outcome response/partial response/no response will be analysed using logistic regression with randomized treatment as the only factor and presented as the common odds ratio with 95% CI and 2-sided p-value, at 8 months (primary time point) and at 4 months. Remission at the same time points will be analysed using logistic regression and presented as odds ratios with 95% CI and 2-sided p-value.\n\nWorld Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) results will be presented as domain scores based on item response theory based scoring, and total disability score. Domain and total scores over time will be described using individual time series plots and mean value plots by randomized treatment. Domain and total scores, and linear change from baseline scores, at each time point will be described by randomized treatment using dot plots, scatter plots with baseline value on the x-axis, and tables of mean, standard deviation, median, min, max and quartiles. Total disability score at 8 months (primary) and 4 months will be analysed using a linear model with randomized treatment and baseline score as covariates and presented as mean difference with 95% CI and 2-sided p-value.\n\nYale Brown Obsessive Compulsion Scale (Y-BOCS) results will be presented and analyzed in the same way as WHODAS disability score. In addition, the number and proportion of patients with score 15 or below will be presented and analyzed in the same way as remission defined by CGI-S.\n\nBush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) total score over time will be described using individual time series plots and mean value plots by randomized treatment. Domain and total scores, and linear change from baseline scores, at each time point will be described by randomized treatment using dot plots, scatter plots with baseline value on the x-axis, and tables of mean, standard deviation, median, min, max and quartiles.\n\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global sum will be tabulated descriptively by randomized treatment for each time point, using mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, min and max, and number and percentage of patients with global sum 5 or higher.\n\nEuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) domain scores will be presented for each time point using descriptive frequency tables and stacked bar charts by randomized treatment. EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale scores will be presented for each time point using descriptive tables of mean, standard deviation, median, min, max and quartiles.\n\nMismatch Negativity (MMN) amplitude and latency will be measured as the most negative data point within the 80-130 ms latency window, post-stimulus onset and compared between time points.\n\nBiomarkers over time will be presented descriptively using individual time series plots and plots of geometric mean values over time by randomized treatment, and for each visit scatter plots with baseline on the x-axis and tables of geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation (CV), median, quartiles, min and max, based on values over the limit of quantification, and number of observations under the limit of quantification. For infusion safety markers, the number and proportion of patients with values outside normal will also be tabulated. Biomarker concentrations at 8 months (primary) and 4 months will be analysed using a linear model for the log-transformed biomarker with randomized treatment and log-transformed baseline biomarker as covariates, and presented as the geometric mean ratio with 95% CI and two-sided p-value.\n\nDETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE Within- and between-patient standard deviation was estimated to 7.1 and 6.7 points respectively, from five case series with in total 35 measurements pre- and post-rituximab treatment, using a linear mixed-effect model with random intercept and rituximab treatment as a fixed factor.\n\nPower was estimated using simulation. Baseline and 8 months BPRS were simulated with a 7 point standard deviation (SD) normally distributed random variation both within and between patients (corresponding to a total SD=9.8 points for a single measurement), and a homogenous treatment effect, using R v. 3.3.1. 40 patients, 20 patients per group, would give 81% power to detect an 8 point adjusted mean difference in BPRS between the rituximab and placebo groups, and 89% power to detect a difference of 9 points. Reasonable power would be retained under 5% random drop-out, with 79% power to detect an 8 point difference and 87% power to detect a 9 point difference between the groups. The power to detect a 9 point difference would still be 85% with 10% random drop-out.	2022-05-01	2026-04-01	2026-05-01	2020-03-26	\N	2022-05-17	\N	Uppsala University Hospital	Janet Cunningham	MD Associate Professor Janet Cunningham	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 2"}	{"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder","Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior",Schizophrenia,"Delusional Disorder","Brief Psychotic Disorder","Schizo Affective Disorder","Other Psychoses","Unspecified Psychosis"}	pre-medication	cetirizine	Todo check usecase, prev: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder	f	Infusion Reaction	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Debnath M, Venkatasubramanian G.

Single Group Assignment	The Methodist Hospital Research Institute	OTHER	All	\N	18	36	Anticipated	OTHER	The Methodist Hospital Research Institute	N/A	\N	None (Open Label)	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	This is a Phase II trial with a dose escalation/de-escalation lead-in that will investigate the efficacy and safety of an iNOS inhibitor and nab-paclitaxel in combination with alpelisib in patients with HER2 negative, metastatic or locally advanced MpBC. The prognosis for metastatic or locally advanced metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC), a rare and highly chemotherapy-resistant subtype of TNBC, is even worse than for non-metaplastic TNBC, with a median overall survival ranging from 3 to 8 months.1 Standard systemic chemotherapy remains the only available treatment option for patients with metastatic or locally advanced MpBC, even though this disease is largely refractory to cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, combination strategies to understand and overcome mechanisms of resistance to improve marginal chemotherapeutic efficacy are needed to improve the prognosis of these patients. We have found that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a critical target for overcoming chemotherapy resistance in TNBC.2,3 iNOS expression is increased and associated with poor prognosis in invasive TNBC and MpBC.2-5 It has been shown that nitric oxide (NO) through iNOS induces many of the major oncogenic pathways such as RAS/ERK, HIF1α, NF- κB, and others making this a unique oncogenic driver. One of the major oncogenic pathways activated by iNOS/NO is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.6-9 Alterations in the Pl3K/Akt pathway have also been linked with chemotherapy resistance, especially in MpBC.10-14 We hypothesize that addition of the PI3K inhibitor, alpelisib, to a pan-NOS inhibitor (L-NMMA) and nab-paclitaxel will increase objective response rate (ORR) in patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced MpBC. Both first- and second-line patients will be eligible for this trial. Patients may have received prior immunotherapy, per standard of care.	2023-01-01	2026-12-01	2028-12-02	2022-12-21	\N	2022-12-21	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 2"}	{"HER2-negative Breast Cancer","Metastatic Breast Cancer","Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma","TNBC - Triple-Negative Breast Cancer"}	minimal	\N	Todo usecase	f	Safety Evaluation	\N	{"Moreno AC, Lin YH, Bedrosian I, Shen Y, Babiera GV, Shaitelman SF.

Each facility has somewhat different design characteristics and pollen dispersal technologies. Facilities are located in disparate geographic areas and have populations of participants who are sensitized to allergens unique to that area. Therefore, facilities have operated as single sites with little effort to evaluate facility comparability or to attempt standardization across facilities. The purpose of this study is to compare the two sites and assess whether the sites are able to achieve similar symptom scores.	Crossover Assignment	Queen's University	OTHER	All	65	18	98	Actual	OTHER	Queen's University	Randomized	\N	Double	\N	\N	Other	\N	When CACF have been designed with a high degree of rigor, quality assurance and validation testing, the exposure to controlled levels of pollen in such facilities as the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) and the Biogenics Research Chamber (BRC) will demonstrate comparable/standardized symptomatic responses. This will be demonstrable not only following pollen exposure but will also have similar reductions in symptoms following treatment with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication known to be effective for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis ( SAR); cetirizine 10mg. Because of quality assurance and validation testing completed at these facilities a priori, this comparability will be demonstrated despite their disparate geographical physical locations and the utilization of these facilities of somewhat different mechanical and technical materials and methods to achieve similar outcomes.\n\nThis multi-center study of SAR will enroll 50 participants at each site. These participants will be age 18-65, male and female, with a mixture of ethnic groups. The study will involve 3 Phases: Screening, Treatment Exposure Visit, and a cross-over Treatment Exposure Visit. In all stages, a CACF visit will be pivotal to determine participant eligibility for enrollment and response to therapy. The qualifying participants will receive a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention with cetirizine HCl 10mg.\n\nAll participants will give written informed consent prior to any study related procedures being performed. Participants who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria during the screening process will be asked to return to the EEU for their first pollen exposure visit (Treatment Visit #1). At the Screening Visit participants will provide a full medical history and undergo a physical examination. They will have their height/weight and vitals measured and skin testing will be performed to confirm allergic response to a panel of common aeroallergens. Women of child bearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Eligible participants will be invited back to the research centre for 4 pollen exposure visits at 2 of these visits participants will receive either cetirizine or placebo. All participants will receive placebo at some point throughout the study.	2015-10-01	2016-02-01	2016-05-01	2015-09-07	2019-04-09	2019-04-09	Kingston General Hospital	Queen's University	Dr. Anne Ellis	Chair, Division of Allergy & Immunology	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Allergic Rhinitis"}	minimal	cetirizine	H1RAs are not the focus	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{}	CT_RESULTS	\N	cetirizine

Furthermore the study is to investigate how relevant for these patients their nasal obstruction and the effect of levocetirizine on their nasal obstruction are.	Parallel Assignment	Institut für Atemwegsforschung GmbH	INDUSTRY	All	65	18	60	Actual	INDUSTRY	Institut für Atemwegsforschung GmbH	Randomized	\N	Triple	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	The study is performed according to a monocentre, double-blind, placebo controlled, two arm parallel group design. It is divided in 3 periods: A 7 ± 2 day screening phase when patients are not to treat their perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) is followed by a 29 ± 4 day treatment period when patients administer either levocetirizine 5 mg OD or placebo and a 14 ± 2 week post treatment observation period when again medication against PAR is not to be taken. However in all study periods patients are provided cromoglicine nasal spray and eye drops which in case of severe complaints they may use as rescue medication.\n\nThroughout the study patients keep a diary documenting the severity of their nasal and ocular symptoms of allergy. Every morning and every evening they use a 4-point scale (0 = no symptom, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) to rate nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing and ocular complaints they experienced during the preceding 12 hours. Furthermore they report adverse events and intake of drugs inclusive of rescue and (during treatment period) study medication.\n\nPatients attend 5 visits to the study site. On visit 1 medical history and concomitant medication are assessed and patients undergo a physical examination, a pregnancy test in case of women of child bearing potential, and, if necessary, a skin prick test. Blood is taken to estimate creatinine clearance. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are checked and, if they do not contradict study continuation, patients enter the screening period which ends in the morning of the day visit 2. If on this visit morning diary reports show sufficiently high nasal obstruction scores and study participation still complies with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients are randomized and start the treatment period taking the first dose at the study site. On visit 2 as well as on the following visits adverse events and use of medication are surveyed and compliance is checked. Visit 3, 4 and 5 are scheduled after one week of treatment, between treatment and post treatment observation period and at the end of the study respectively. On visit 5 there is a final physical examination and again females of childbearing potential undergo a pregnancy test. To assess how relevant for patients nasal obstruction and the effect of the study medication on nasal obstruction are questionnaires are completed on each visit.	2007-02-01	2007-05-01	2007-05-01	2007-02-26	\N	2008-01-15	\N	\N	\N	\N	Claus Bachert MD PhD	Institut für Atemwegsforschung GmbH	\N	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Perennial Allergic Rhinitis"}	main	levocetirizine	\N	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-09-15 18:58:14	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	levocetirizine

In ILIT group, initial dose of allergen will be 1,000-fold diluted solution from maximal concentration of allergen extract for subcutaneous immunotherapy (Tyrosine S, Allergy Therapeutic, West Sussex, UK) in volume of 0.1ml. If skin is highly reactive in skin prick test, the initial dose will be 10-fold dilution from maximal concentration where diameter of wheal is less than that of histamine. After the first dose, allergen concentration will be escalated 3-fold at second dose, and 10-fold at third dose if there are no (or mild) local or systemic hypersensitivity reaction. The allergen concentration will not change at second or third dose if there is moderate local or systemic reaction. The allergen concentration will decrease by 10 or 100-fold from previous concentration or further injection will be held if there is severe local or systemic reaction after sufficient explanation and discussion with subjects.\n\nThe investigators will evaluate allergic rhinitis symptom score before and 4, 12 months after the initial treatment. Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) will be used. Visual analogue scale (VAS) of symptoms including rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, eye/nose/ear/palate itching, dyspnea, wheezing, chest discomfort as well as urticaria, angioedema, and itching on exposed skin during exposure to causal allergen in daily life will be also evaluated. Skin prick test (SPT), intradermal test (IDT), blood sampling for serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), allergen-specific IgE, and allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), nasal lavage for Th1, Th2, and Treg cytokines, and nasal provocation test (NPT) with Df and/or Dp allergen (in subjects whose AR symptoms are provoked by Df and/or Dp) will be also performed before and 4, 12 months after the initial treatment. In addition, the investigators evaluated the change of subjects' recognition of causal allergens, their avoidance, and AIT during this study. Using VAS, subjects were requested to score the rate of agreement with "Allergen provokes allergic symptoms in daily life", "Allergen avoidance can reduce allergic symptoms", "Allergen-specific Immunotherapy (AIT) can reduce allergic symptoms", "I can pay 50,000 Korean Won (KRW)/month for allergen avoidance", "I can pay 100,000 KRW/month for allergen avoidance", "I can pay 200,000 KRW/month for allergen avoidance", "I can pay 150,000 KRW for each injection of ILIT", "I can pay 300,000 KRW for each injection of ILIT", "I can pay 600,000 KRW for each injection of ILIT" before and after SPT/IDT, after NPT, 4 months and 1 year after ILIT.\n\nAdverse events will be recorded and graded according to Muller classification and Ring and Meissner classification.	2016-07-01	2019-12-01	2020-01-01	2016-01-28	\N	2020-02-11	\N	Gachon University Gil Medical Center	Sangmin Lee, MD	Assistant Professor	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 1"}	{"Allergic Rhinitis"}	rescue medication	cetirizine	\N	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Senti G, Johansen P, Kundig TM.

People with AN are at high risk for certain health problems, such as depression, osteoporosis, substance abuse, and cardiovascular and neurological complications. Current treatments for AN include different forms of psychotherapy and medications, but the success of these treatments is highly variable among people with AN. A better pathophysiologic understanding of AN is needed in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating the disorder. Current research is targeting dopamine (DA), a neurotransmitter that is released in response to pleasurable stimuli, such as food and drugs. Animal studies have found that chronic food restriction may alter functioning of the DA system by reducing DA response to food and drug stimuli. A better understanding of the effects of disordered eating on the DA systems of people with AN may provide insight into the development of new and improved treatments for people with AN. This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to investigate changes in DA systems in people with AN before and after both weight restoration and administration of methylphenidate, a psychostimulant medication. The study will also use PET imaging to compare DA systems of people with AN with DA systems of people who are healthy.\n\nThis study will involve both healthy participants and participants with AN. Study participation for healthy participants will include two PET scans and one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which, if the participants prefer, can all be completed in one study visit. Study participation for participants with AN will include three PET and two MRI scans. The first PET and MRI scans will be performed upon entry into the hospital as an inpatient. The remaining scans will be conducted 2 to 4 weeks after participants have accomplished weight restoration.\n\nIncluding preparation, each MRI study will last about 45 minutes and each PET study will last about 3 hours. For each MRI study, participants will be asked to lie on their backs for 15 minutes in the MRI scanner. For each PET study, participants will first be injected with a dose of [11C]raclopride, a radioactive drug used in brain imaging, and will then lie on their backs for 30 minutes in the PET scanner.\n\nOne hour before the second PET scan for healthy participants and the third PET scan for participants with AN, participants will receive an oral dose of methylphenidate. During these scans, participants will also undergo blood pressure monitoring and an electrocardiogram (EKG). Once participants no longer feel the effects of the methylphenidate and their vital signs have returned to normal, they will be discharged from the medical center and study participation will be complete.	2008-07-01	2015-07-01	2015-12-01	2008-05-01	\N	2016-04-07	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Observational	{Adult}	{}	{"Eating Disorders"}	not included	fexofenadine	name of investigator\n	f	Eating Disorders	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{}	UNKNOWN	\N	fexofenadine

The treatment purpose is to prevent or alleviate symptoms as safely and effectively as possible. Above all, it is recommended that patients avoid contact with allergens to which they are sensitive. However, this is often not enough, and pharmacological interventions are often required.\n\nH1 antihistamines (anti-H1) are considered first-line drugs in the treatment of AR1. These drugs effectively relieve symptoms of the immediate phase of AR, such as nasal pruritus, sneezing, runny nose and associated eye symptoms, and partially the nasal blockage characteristic of the late phase of the disease. Due to their excellent safety profile and therapeutic advantages in the treatment of AR, second-generation anti-H1 drugs, such as levocetirizine, should always be prioritized over older compounds in all age groups1.\n\nThe combined administration of an antihistamine and an oral decongestant was shown to b more effective than the administration of an antihistamine alone for the relief of AR-associated nasal obstruction1.\n\nLevocetirizine is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) registered in the country as a monodrug for oral administration at a dose of 5mg. Pseudoephedrine is not marketed as a monodrug for oral use in our area, but it is registered in FDC with antihistamines, which is why there is no comparator arm treating with pseudoephedrine only. These products are widely used and their efficacy and safety are well known in daily clinical practice in the proposed indication.\n\nOnce the absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between levocetirizine and pseudoephedrine has been confirmed in relative bioavailability studies (RBA), this phase 3 study will be conducted in order to demonstrate the superiority of FDC levocetirizine 5mg / pseudoephedrine 240mg over levocetirizine 5mg administered alone in the symptomatic treatment of AR, particularly with regard to nasal obstruction. The registration seeks to provide a new effective and safe therapeutic option to address these cases.	Parallel Assignment	Eurofarma Laboratorios S.A.

Indeed, the latest American clinical guidelines recommended acupuncture treatment for AR patients who are interested in non-pharmacological treatment.\n\nIn conventional acupuncture treatment for AR, needles are inserted at specific acupoints in the body; with several studies demonstrating acupuncture of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) to improve nasal symptoms and quality of life in nasal inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that, compared with sham acupuncture and rescue medication (RM), active SPG acupuncture combined with RM would lead to greater improvements in symptoms score and reduction in overall need for antihistamines. To test this hypothesis the investigators design a randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of SPG acupuncture in pollen-induced seasonal AR patients and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms.

It is characterized by erythema, itchy papules, occasionally vesicles (in infants), which may become excoriated and lichenified and have a typical flexural distribution. Atopy is defined as a "personal or familial tendency to produce immunoglobulin antibodies in response to even low doses of allergen, and associated with development of AD, asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis.The worldwide prevalence of AD is estimated to be 20% in children and 2-10% in adults. The incidence of AD has increased by 2 to 3 folds in past 3 decades in the industrialized countries and represents a major public health burden. According to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) phase 3, the prevalence of AD among the age group of 13 to 14 in Africa and Latin America was at 12-14% and 6-10% respectively. The Asian Pacific countries, the Eastern Mediterranean region and the Indian subcontinent, it was 3-6% among the same age groups (13-14 years). Whereas among 6 to 7 years children, for Asian Pacific countries, Africa and Latin America the prevalence of AD was around 10% and in Indian subcontinent and Eastern Mediterranean region, value was lower at 3-5%\n\nIn Nepal the frequency of AD in all age group was 2% as per a year hospital based study done by Singh S and Agrawal S et.al in 2012. (Unpublished data, on personal communication)\n\nThe pathogenesis of AD appears to result from interaction between various genetic and environmental factors. It is associated with skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation. The barrier dysfunction is early feature of AD which may be a primary but may also be a secondary to skin inflammation. Lack of exposure to microbial stimuli in early life programs the immune system towards Th2-type allergic response as described by 'hygiene hypothesis'.In allergic disorders there is shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards a Th2 response, and causes the release of Interleukin-4, interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 as well as Immunoglobulin E production.\n\nThe diagnosis of AD is mainly clinical as there is no specific test for AD. Diagnosis of AD is based on specific a criterion which includes patient's history, clinical presentations as well as family history. In 1980 Hanifin and Rajka proposed major and minor diagnostic criteria based on clinical symptoms of AD. Williams coordinated a UK working party to attempt to simplify and refine the criteria given by Hanifin and Rajka in 1994. Severity of disease is evaluated by using widely accepted SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), based on extent of area involved, severity of symptoms and intensity of the subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep disturbances.The chronic and recurrent nature of AD negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) of patients as well as their family members. The symptoms of AD limit patient's physical, psychosocial development and quality of sleep.\n\nThe main goals of treatment are to improve the skin barrier function and hydration, to suppress inflammation and to control microbial colonization. It can be achieved through emollients, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitor like tacrolimus. Oral drugs like corticosteroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine are reserved for severe cases.\n\nProbiotics are defined by World Health Orgnization as "live microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host."Under the hypothesis that probiotics have global allergy protective effect, they have been extensively used for several conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, bronchial asthma and other allergic diseases. If children who are genetically predisposed to AD are supplemented with probiotics early in their life, series of events like antigenic competition, immune regulation and stimulation of innate immunity will occur, all of which might minimize their susceptibility to allergic disorders. Hence, investigators planned this study to see its role in AD.\n\nStatement of problem and rationale:\n\nThe rationale for this therapeutic option is based on well-established effects of bacteria on cellular immune responses. The probiotics has an immunomodulatory property that plays an essential role in the development of normal immune tolerance. Early life exposure to these microbial agents plays an important role in maturation of Type 1 helper cell (Th1) immune responses and could inhibit development of allergic Type 2 helper cell (Th2) responses and IgE antibody production. Therefore the onset of AD could be prevented by probiotics and this treatment strategy could also be effective even when AD is already established.\n\nIn a meta-analysis conducted in 2017, involving 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) with 1,070 children, significant difference in SCORAD values favoring probiotics over the control group was observed. Though, a high degree of heterogeneity was observed across these 13 trials.\n\nCochrane review, 2018 which included 39 RCTs found that probiotic treatment may slightly reduce SCORAD value. However the researcher concluded that the differences were not clinically significant. Recent review in 2019 on "prebiotics and probiotics in atopic dermatitis" based on various RCT and meta-analysis support the supplementation of probiotics for at least 8 weeks in improving severity score of AD.\n\nInvestigators have observed conflicting results of different studies with some showing significant advantages while some studies revealing no benefit. Almost all of the studies have suggested further research in different populations. Therefore, we are conducting this study to find out the effect of probiotics in AD in our institute.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nPrimary objective: To investigate the efficacy of oral probiotics in the clinical outcome of Atopic dermatitis based on the SCORAD index\nSecondary objectives: To find out the total duration of topical corticosteroid use in the interventional and conventional group.\n\nTo assess the impact of AD in children's family members based on FDLQI (Family Dermatology Life Quality Index)\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Type of study design: Assessor blinded, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Hospital (Dermatology Outpatient Department, BPKIHS, Dharan). The probable duration of the study will be one year after approval from the Institutional Review Committee and Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC). Ethical Clearance: taken from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC), BPKIHS, and Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC).\n\nCalculation of the sample size: According to a study done by Ekaputri et.al, it is reported that mean± SD of SCORAD index after intervention in probiotic group and control group was (18.09 ± 8.59) and (23.21± 8.71) respectively. Considering the least difference, 5.12 and pooled SD- 8.65, the sample size has been calculated at 95% CI and 80% power, using two means formula.\n\nn = 44.56, adding 10% in calculated value for lost to follow-up, final sample size is 45 in each group. Thus a total of 98 patients will be enrolled.\n\nn = 2σ2 (Z α/2 + Z β) 2 (μ1- μ2) 2\n\nn= sample size of each group. σ = standard deviation 8.65 Z = reliability coefficient. 1.96 α = significance level. 0.05 Zβ= at 20% power 0.84 μ1 = mean (Probiotic) 18.09 μ2 = mean (Control) 23.21 d = mean difference 5.12\n\nRandomization and allocation concealment:\n\nA block randomization list will be generated with the block sizes 4, 6 and 8. Two parallel groups (1:1 ratio) of patients following computerized randomization will be produced. Prior to the enrollment of the patients a sequentially generated number with the treatment group will be written in sealed envelope, which will be prepared by independent dermatologist.\n\nInterventional and conventional groups:\n\nInterventional group: Children with AD meeting eligibility criteria receiving probiotics and conventional treatment (topical corticosteroid, topical tacrolimus, an oral antihistamine and emollients) Conventional group: Children with AD meeting eligibility criteria, under conventional treatment only.\n\nFollow up:\n\nEach patient will be asked for their follow up at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks of commencing treatment. In each follow up, every patient will be evaluated for the side effects and compliance to treatment. SCORAD index will be measured at baseline and at 4, 8, 10 and 12 weeks. FDLQI will be measured at baseline and at 8 weeks. Parents will be provided a card to record for flare of symptoms; total days of steroid use for the same and total flare episode will be recorded during 12 weeks follow up. Flare is defined as worsening of clinical features leading to use of corticosteroids for at least 3 consecutive days.\n\nFamily dermatology life quality index:\n\nParents or guardian of each children will be asked to fill the questionnaire intended to measure quality of life of family members whose relative have dermatological conditions. The standardized nepali version of FDLQI (MKA Basra, AY Finlay. Cardiff University 2005) will be used. Questions concern the influence of disease on parents QOL in the last month. Each question can be answered by selecting 1 out of 4 answers scored 0-3. The maximum score is 30 points and minimum 0 point. The higher the score lower the parents QOL.\n\nSeverity Index (SCORAD) It uses the rule of nine to assess extent of disease and evaluates five clinical characteristics to determine disease severity: i) erythema, ii) edema/ papulation, iii) oozing/crusts, iv) excoriation and v) lichenification. It also assesses subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss with Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).\n\nBased on SCORAD score, AD is categorized as\n\nMild AD (SCORAD <25)\nModerate (SCORAD 25-50)\nSevere (SCORAD >50)\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n\nStatistical analysis will be conducted both per protocol and intention to treat population (defined as all enrolled children to whom study drug will be given; with the last observation carried forward) basis using two sided tests.\n\nStatistical methods proposed:\n\nDescriptive statistics will be summarized as mean, median, percentage, standard deviation (SD) and interquartile range along with appropriate graphical and tabular presentation.\nIntragroup SCORAD index and FDLQI score will be compared by paired t-test and between the groups by independent t- test.\nIn case of nonparametric data Mann- Whitney U test for independent groups and Wilcoxon signed- rank test for paired group will be used.\nChi-square test will be used to compare the categorical data. All statistical tests will be carried out at a significance level P<0.05.	2021-01-03	2021-09-30	2021-12-15	2021-01-13	\N	2021-12-16	\N	B.P.

To test this hypothesis the investigators design a randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of SPG acupuncture in perennial AR patients (allergic to indoor allergens, including house dust mite, fungi, animal dander and so one) and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms.

At present, the major treatments for allergic rhinitis are avoiding allergens, medical treatment and surgery. However, inadequate effects, and possible side effects of these treatments are still problems to these patients. Therefore, to find an effective non-medical and non-surgical treatment will be of great help in treating patients with allergic rhinitis.\n\nInfrared-C (far-infrared) ray irradiation is able to promote normal operation of autonomic nervous system, to improve blood circulation and thereby assumed to relieve discomfort symptoms of patients with vascular, specific or non-specific allergic rhinitis. Consequently, infrared-C ray irradiation is expected to be effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThe investigators aimed to probe the adjunct effects of infrared-C ray irradiation in terms of infrared-C hot compress in improving allergy symptoms like sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, nose and conjunctiva itching during a medical treatment for patients with allergic rhinitis. Moreover, the impact of infrared-C irradiation on health and life quality enhancement will also be studied.

Thirty persons in the experimental group received both medical and infrared-C irradiation as intervention. On the other hand, twenty persons in the control group received only medical treatment. Patients in experimental group received anti-histamine, steroid nasal spray and infrared-C irradiation by hot compress for 40 minutes per time, and more than three times per week. The regions of hot compress included head, neck and shoulder, back and lower back, which covered many acupuncture points frequently used by traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In addition, patients also received hot compress over face, eyes and nose during acute stage of allergic rhinitis.	Single	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	This is a quasi-experimental design. The study subjects are recruited from patients visited to a Ear-Nose-Throat Out Patient Department in a regional teaching hospital in south Taiwan. The sampling method is purposive sampling. The inclusion criteria are adults between 20 and 50 year-old with a definite clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. Subjects were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. Thirty persons in the experimental group received both medical and infrared-C ray irradiation by hot compress as intervention. On the other hand, twenty persons in the control group took only medical treatment. Patients in experimental group received anti-histamine, steroid nasal spray and infrared-C ray irradiation for 40 minutes each time, and more than three times per week. The regions for hot compress included head, neck and shoulder, back and lower back, which covered many acupuncture points frequently used by traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, including point Dazhui (GV14), Dingchuan (EX-B1) , Dazhu (BL11), Fengmen (BL12), Feishu (BL13), Pishu (BL20), and Shenshu (BL23). In addition, patients also received infrared-C hot compress over face, eyes and nose during acute stage of allergic rhinitis. The investigators used a questionnaire as a pre-test to collect basic information of the subjects, and Taiwan's Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20) nose and sinusitis evaluation form as pre-middle and post-test to evaluate the effect of the interventions. World Health Organization Quality of Life Instruments (WHOQOL-BREF) and Taiwan's concise edition of WHOQOL II questionnaire were also used as basic data collection tools for allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, blood tests for patient's serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophil cationic protein levels were determined before and after experiment. Pre-test for the experimental and control group was carried out before the intervention, the first post-test was performed 4 weeks later, and the second post-test was carried out 12 weeks later.

The Rome IV criteria are based on abdominal pain symptoms and stool habits including stool frequency and stool forms [1]. They define 3 main subtypes based on symptoms: 1) IBS with diarrhea; 2) IBS with constipation: and 3) mixed symptoms of constipation and diarrhea. The IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) subtype has the highest prevalence. Currently, treatment of IBS-D includes antidiarrheals, bile acid sequestrants, antispasmodics, tricyclic antidepressants, and FODMAP diet. However, many patients are intolerant or unresponsive to the above treatments. Outside of IBS, chronic diarrhea affects about 5% of adults. We have described a syndrome in a subset of IBS patients presenting with post prandial diarrhea, flushing and dermatographia whose symptoms are prevented by pre-treatment with combined H1 and H2 antihistamines [2]. However, the prevalence of this syndrome among the IBS + D patients is not known nor have the clinical characteristics or predictors of antihistamine responsive IBS + D been defined.	\N	University of Cincinnati	OTHER	All	\N	18	100	Anticipated	OTHER	University of Cincinnati	\N	\N	\N	\N	Case-Only	\N	Prospective	We have published a series of 5 patients with chronic post prandial diarrhea (PPD) that begins within 3 hours after eating, associated with dermatographia, responsive to antihistamines [2]. In these cases, no underlying causes were identified to explain PPD; diagnoses of food allergy, lactose intolerance, celiac disease, dumping syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic mastocytosis were excluded. Patients with the syndrome have prior histories of chronic urticaria and experience associated transient symptoms of flushing, headache, tachycardia, and abdominal bloating during PPD episodes.\n\nThis syndrome, except for our published report, have not been previously described in the medical literature. Patients with systemic mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome experience PPD but along with anaphylactic manifestations (e.g. wheezing, hypotension) and measurable mast cell biomarkers are identifiable in affected patients (i.e. serum mast cell tryptase or 24 hour urine methylhistamine, PGF2a). Therefore, it is important to characterize PPD responsive to antihistamines in a general GI patient population and to publish our findings. The impact on human health will be substantial; we found that these patients are undiagnosed and untreated for many years.\n\nOur aim is to recruit 50-100 patients from the UC Health affiliated gastroenterology clinics with access UC health which has 300-500 potential subjects. We would need to recruit 10-20% percentage of these potential subjects.

Randomized	\N	Quadruple	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of a single oral dose of JNJ-39758979 on histamine-induced itch and hive in 24 healthy male volunteers. This is a three-treatment, double-blind (neither the volunteer nor the study physician will know the identity of the treatment), cross-over (each volunteer receives all three treatments) study. The study is also randomized, meaning that the order in which treatments are given is determined randomly (by chance, like flipping a coin). The total participation time is approximately 8 to 9 weeks, which includes a screening visit, three treatment periods, two wash-out periods (breaks), and a follow-up visit after the third treatment period. All three treatment periods require a 2-day stay in the clinic. Volunteers will have a histamine test at the screening visit and three times during each treatment period (total of 10 tests). The histamine test consists of an injection of a small amount of histamine solution into the upper layer of the skin, which may cause itchiness, a flare response (redness on the skin) and wheal response (elevated bump in the skin) lasting for 30 to 60 minutes. Volunteers will be blindfolded during the procedure and asked to rate the severity of the itch. The areas of the wheal and flare will be measured by a laser scanner, which will not cause harm to the volunteer. During the treatment periods, volunteers will receive the histamine test on the day before study drug and/or placebo is given and at 2 and 6 hours after study drug and/or placebo is given. During the study, safety evaluations, which will include ECGs (a cardiac function test) and vital signs, will be performed, and side effects will be monitored. Blood and urine samples will be collected at the screening visit, during the first day of each treatment period in the clinic and at the follow-up visit for evaluation.

They are commonly used by divers, to solve ear, nose and throat problems, especially to open tubal passage. However, the effects of these drugs on cognitive performance have not been investigated during diving.The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of levocetirizine, hydroxyzine and placebo on cognitive and psychomotor functioning during controlled simulated diving in a hyperbaric chamber in professional navy divers at 10 mt (2 bar) and 30 mt (4 bar).It is hypothesized that hydroxyzine will produce significant impairment, and that the magnitude of impairment is related to hyperbaric pressure.

At the test day, subjects receive one of the three medications. One hour after administration of the drugs, subjects will start with the dive in the recompression chamber. After one hour, medication has reached their peak plasma concentration, and effects can be expected. There will be a wash-out period of at least 7 days between the test days.\n\nSubjects will perform one simulated dive at each test day. They first descend in 2 min to a pressure of 4 bar (30 mt), stay for 20 min, the dive continues when they ascend to a pressure of 2 bar (10 mt) with another stay for 20 min. At both depths the 20 min periods are the measuring period to perform the test. At the end they will go to the surface according the decompression profile and stop for 3 min at 9 mt, 8 min at 6 mt and 23 min at 3 mt. These decompression stops are regular for the profile and necessary to prevent decompression sickness.Before and after diving, and at 2 and 4 bar, tests measuring attention, memory, psychomotor, concentration and comprehension ability of the participants are conducted.	2012-04-01	2012-10-01	2012-10-01	2011-12-21	\N	2013-11-06	\N	Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences	Dr Joris C Verster	Assistant professor	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Healthy Volunteers"}	main	levocetirizine	Is that really repurpose or safety evaluation?	f	Safety Evaluation	2022-09-15 18:58:14	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	levocetirizine

Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 are separated by a 3 to 7 day washout period between doses. A study flow chart for the PK phase is presented in Figure 1. Patients will receive osimertinib 80 mg as a single dose on Day 1 of Treatment Period 2, then 80 mg once daily for 38 days (from Day 4 to Day 41 in Treatment Period 2). Patients will also receive a single oral dose of fexofenadine on Day 1 in Treatment Period 1, and on Days 1 and 39 in Treatment Period 2.\n\nContinued access On completion of the PK phase (ie, following collection of the 72-hour fexofenadine sample on Day 42), patients may continue to take osimertinib tablets (80 mg once daily) as a single agent in continued access if they and the Investigator agree that this is appropriate. This will continue until the Investigator believes they are no longer deriving clinical benefit, or they stop taking osimertinib for any other reason. No clinical data will be collected during this phase other than sudden death of unknown reason, serious adverse events (SAEs) that may be related to osimertinib, outcomes of pregnancy and drug dispensing/accountability.\n\nIf a patient discontinues treatment during the PK phase, they will return to the clinic for follow-up assessments 30 days (±7 days) after their last dose of treatment in the PK phase. If the patient's last dose of osimertinib is in continued access, the patient should be contacted 30 days after their last dose of osimertinib to follow-up any existing SAEs, monitor for new SAEs that may be related to the IP, and record any sudden deaths of unknown cause.	2017-03-02	2017-07-31	2022-10-11	2016-09-21	\N	2022-11-14	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 1"}	{"Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"}	combination	fexofenadine	TODO, more pharmakokinetics?\n	f	Cancer	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{"Calvo E, Lee JS, Kim SW, Moreno V, deCastro Carpeno J, Weilert D, Laus G, Mann H, Vishwanathan K.

The study is designed to estimate the magnitude of the effects of JNJ-56021927 on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates. In vitro studies have indicated that JNJ-56021927 and its active metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) have the potential to affect multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8) and drug transporters proteins (P-glycoprotein [P-gp] and breast cancer resistance protein [BRCP]) via inhibition or induction. In human hepatocytes, JNJ 56021927 and JNJ-56142060 (M3) were found to be inducers of CYP3A4. The induction of CYP3A4 suggests that JNJ-56021927 and M3 will induce other CYP isozymes and drug transporters (eg, CYP2C and P-gp via activation of pregnane X receptor).

Due to the high prevalence of diabetes and because 30-40% of diabetic patients [both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus] develop kidney dysfunction, diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the main cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), endothelin, and urotensin II are vasoactive hormones that have been extensively studied as other mediators although their relation to diabetic nephropathy is still speculative.

In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the one catheter will be less time consuming to place and facilitate early ambulation of the patient.	Parallel Assignment	University of Louisville	OTHER	All	70	18	75	Actual	OTHER	University of Louisville	Randomized	\N	Single	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	After obtaining written informed consent, all patients will be sedated with 1-5 mg midazolam and up to 100 mcg fentanyl before any procedure is performed. They will be attached to standard ASA monitors and their vital signs recorded before sedation and every 5 minutes throughout the procedure. They will receive supplemental oxygen 2-4 LPM with a nasal canula. They will be given 1 g acetaminophen orally with a sip of water before sedation.\n\nThe randomization envelope will be opened and the patient will be randomized to one of the two groups.\n\nAll patients will receive a femoral nerve block after identification of the landmarks or with ultrasound guidance and a femoral catheter will be inserted perineurally. The patients will be placed supine position for the procedure. The femoral artery will be identified either by ultrasound or a hand held Doppler. A point 1 cm lateral to the femoral artery and 1 cm below the inguinal crease is marked. A 5 cm Tuohy needle (Pajunk Medical) will be inserted at a 45° angle at 1.5 mA and 1 Hz. Once a brisk quadriceps twitch is identified, the needle will be positioned accurately so as to establish quadriceps stimulation at ≤ 0.5 mA.\n\nThe peripheral nerve catheter will be inserted through the needle. Once the catheter is positioned satisfactorily in the perineural area, it will be tunneled subcutaneously and a sterile dressing will be applied to cover the catheter completely. Ropivacaine (30 mL of 0.5%) will be injected through the catheter after frequent aspirations. The block will be assessed by sensory and motor assessments at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes. Sensory testing will be performed on the anterior aspect of the knee (femoral nerve), medial aspect of the knee (obturator nerve) and the lateral aspect of the thigh (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve). The block will be considered complete when no cold discrimination was observed (Score 2), partial when cold discrimination was decreased (score 1), and absent when normal cold discrimination was observed (Score 0). Femoral motor block will also be assessed during the same period by testing knee extension, and will be considered complete when no extension is observed, partial when quadriceps motor force is decreased and absent when normal quadriceps function is observed. Patients with complete sensory block of the femoral and obturator nerves after 15 minutes will be included in the study.\n\nGroup I: Peripheral Nerve group: This group will have a sciatic catheter placed either before or after surgery. They will receive a sciatic catheter by subgluteal approach with the use of ultrasound. The ischial tuberosity will be identified with the ultrasound probe and its midpoint marked. A point 3 cm lateral and 4 cm caudad will be marked. Patients will be placed in the lateral position. A 18 G Tuohy needle will be inserted at a 45° angle until a peroneal or tibial twitch is obtained at 1.5 mA. Once the current can be reduced to obtain a twitch less than 0.5 mA, a catheter will be inserted and placed perineurally. If placed preoperatively, the catheter will be flushed with normal saline or 5% dextrose and will not be dosed until after surgery. After the patient is in the PACU and the surgeons have verified the sciatic nerve function, the sciatic catheter will be dosed with 35 mL 0.25% ropivacaine.\n\nGroup II: Depodur Group: Preoperatively this group of patients will have an L2-L3 epidural placed while they are in the sitting position before or after femoral catheter placement. They will receive 7.5 mg Depodur via the epidural catheter. All of these patients will receive Singular 10 mg and Claritin 10 mg before the epidural Depodur is placed, as per our protocol of patients receiving EREM.\n\nAll patients will receive general anesthesia with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and propofol, as needed, for induction of anesthesia. The patients will be paralyzed with succinylcholine, rocuronium, or any other non-depolarizing muscle relaxant of choice of anesthesiologist. Analgesia will be maintained at the discretion of the anesthesiologist overseeing the case. Anesthesia will be maintained with a volatile anesthetic and oxygen or TIVA to maintain BIS between 40 and 50. Vital signs will be recorded every 15 minutes. They will also receive dexamethasone 4 mg, metoclopramide 20 mg IV at induction and ondansetron 4 mg after induction, if they have more than 40% risk of PONV as per their Apfel score.\n\nPatients will be extubated at the end of the case and transferred to PACU. If patients complain of pain, they will receive fentanyl 25-50-mcg increments as per the discretion of PACU nurse to achieve a VRS < 4. Patients may be prescribed a morphine PCA (1 mg morphine with a 6-minute lockout) for postoperative pain relief in the PACU once their pain is stable at VRS<4.\n\nAll patients will be prescribed acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 hours for 3 days after surgery. They will be prescribed metoclopramide 20 mg IV PRN every 6 hours as rescue medication for nausea and/or vomiting for 2 days postoperatively. Patients still nauseous will get Promethazine (Phenergan) 6.25-12.5 mg as second line rescue.\n\nOnce the patients are transported to the floor, they will be monitored with continuous pulse-oximetry for the first 48 hours. Other vital signs (Pulse, NIBP and Respiratory Rate) will be monitored every hour for the first 12 hours, every 2 hrs from 12-24 hours, and every 4 hours from 24 to 48 hours (ASA 2009 Guidelines for neuraxial opioids).\n\nPostoperative knee joint rehabilitation will involve continuous passive motion (CPM) of the knee joint twice a day. The physical therapist will be asked to record the VRS on movement and the range of motion after placement of the CPM machine.	2009-12-01	2012-12-01	2012-12-01	2009-05-08	2017-07-27	2017-07-27	University Louisville	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	Investigator left institution	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee"}	not included	loratadine	did not find drug anywhere?	f	Knee Joint Replacement	2022-08-17 18:44:47	{}	UNKNOWN	\N	loratadine

It develops resulting from lots of problems. In patient with rhinitis, either allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis, shiners are believed to be caused by venous stasis resulting from nasal congestion. This study is aiming that comparison of the effectiveness of treatment of rhinitis (either allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis) to lighten not only the rhinitis but also the shiners. Randomized control studies.\n\nDesign: The investigators will recruit children (6-12 y/0), adolescent (13-18 y/o), or adults (19-65 y/o) with either allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis, and patients will be randomly assigned to groups (oral antihistamine, combined nasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamine, combined nasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamine plus nasal decongestant, combined nasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamine plus nasal irrigation, combined oral antihistamine with nasal irrigation, or nasal antihistamine only). Digital image will be recorded and analyzed to compare the change of shiners between before and after treatment for rhinitis. The clinical data were collected including patient's data, history, laboratory data, Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ), Adolescent Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (AdolRQLQ), or mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-RQLQ), and medications. The primary outcome is to answer whether the levels of shiners can be alleviated by using therapies in patient with rhinitis. And the secondary outcome is to figure out which therapies work most effectively.\n\nKeywords: allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, shiners, nasal corticosteroids	Parallel Assignment	Camillians Saint Mary's Hospital Luodong	OTHER	All	65	6	450	Anticipated	OTHER	Camillians Saint Mary's Hospital Luodong	Randomized	\N	Single	The independent researchers will carry out the digital image analyze.	\N	Treatment	\N	Background:\n\nShiners results from the accumulation of body fluid in the infraorbital groove. The physiology and pathology in children include nasal congestion, inﬂammation of nose and eyes, trauma to the nose or the forehead, facial surgery, or facial cancer. In patient with either allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion arouses venous stasis, leading to the blue-gray to purple discoloration under the bilateral lower eyelids, called shiners. In patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic shiners, termed by Marks since 1954, have been regarded as a significant sign of allergic rhinitis generally.\n\nIn 2009, Chiang and members established a digital-analyzed tool to quantify allergic shiners, and the results demonstrated the darkness and the area values of allergic shiners correlate with the severity of allergic rhinitis.\n\nA stepwise approach for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis is documented, including oral antihistamine, intranasal antihistamine, intranasal corticosteroids, intranasal decongestant, oral or intranasal leukotriene antagonist, as well as nasal irrigation, but the response of shiners after treatment, and the efficiency of the therapies to alleviate the shiners were unknown. In this study, the primary outcome is to answer whether the levels of shiners can be alleviated by using nasal therapies in patients with allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis. And the secondary outcome is to figure out which nasal therapies work most effectively.\n\nDesign:\n\nThe investigators will recruit children (6-12 years old), adolescent (13-18 years old), and adults (19-65 years old) with moderate to severe rhinitis, either allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis. Those with chronic rhinosinusitis, trauma to the forehead or nose, face surgery, malignancy, pregnancy, and respiratory tract infections or usage of medications for rhinitis within a week before beginning the study will be excluded. Study population will be classified into children, adolescent and adults according to the age.\n\nThis study will be divided into three stages. In the first stage, three kinds of therapies for rhinitis were compared. Patients will be randomly assigned into three groups. Patients in group 1 will use oral antihistamine only, another in group 2 will use combined intranasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamine, and the other in group 3 will use combined intranasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamine plus one-week intranasal decongestant. In the second stage, three kinds of therapies will be compared, including combined intranasal corticosteroids and oral antihistamine, combined intranasal corticosteroids and oral antihistamine plus nasal irrigation, and oral antihistamine plus nasal irrigation. The third stage will compare oral antihistamine only, combined intranasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamine, and intranasal antihistamine. The estimated sample size was 50 cases in each groups, and total 150 cases in each population and total 450 cases in each stage. Patients will be randomized by a randomization table. Minimization will be performed when over 100 cases in each population and in each stage.\n\nA standardized digital photograph of every participant will be recorded and further analyzed to compare the change of shiners between before and after treatment for rhinitis. The clinical data will be collected including patient's data, history, laboratory data, Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) of every children, Adolescent Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (AdolRQLQ) of every adolescent, or mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-RQLQ) of every adult, and medications.\n\nDigital images and the questionnaires, including PRQLQ, AdolRQLQ, and mini-RQLQ, of every participant will be taken at the beginning of the study. Further assessments will be taken at least 3 times, on the seventh day, fourteenth day, and twenty-eighth day after treatment.\n\nThe detail method to take a standardized digital photography, and analyze digital image were described in the previous study. Briefly, in order to standardize both the size and color of the photographs, a color checker used as a reference was set in front of the every participant's chin. Pixel, the elemental unit of digital image, was calculated in each photographs. After completing preprocess in every digital sample, the investigators converted the intensity value of each pixel into the gray level, then measured the gray-level mean values in the infraorbital groove (Sm) and cheek (Cm), respectively. Darkness (D) was equal to Cm-Sm. The blacker a shiner appeared, the bigger the darkness value was. Shiner's area value was figured out by sampling the curve of each lower eyes. The investigators translated the value from pixels to square centimeters, and finally normalized by body surface area to gain the parameter A (in square centimeters per square meter) represented as the area value of shiner.\n\nThe independent researchers will carry out the digital image analyze.\n\nThe primary outcome is to answer whether the levels of shiners can be alleviated by using therapies in patient with rhinitis. And the secondary outcome is to figure out which therapies work most effectively.\n\nStatistical analysis The investigators compared the categorical variables between the two groups using the Pearson's Chi square test. The investigators compared the continuous variables between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between two parameters was analyzed by Pearson correlation test. The investigators used paired samples t-test and/or multiple regression analysis to what kind of treatment was more effective to alleviate the shiners with/without improvement of rhinitis. To account for correlation among repeated measures from the same patient, the study was analyzed with the usage of linear generalized estimating equations. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with International Business Machines Corporation Statistical Product and Service Solutions statistical software (version 20.0.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).	2020-06-16	2032-03-31	2032-03-31	2022-04-27	\N	2022-04-27	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Child,Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Not Applicable"}	{"Allergic Rhinitis","Vasomotor Rhinitis"}	combination	cetirizine	check again for repurpose	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Marks MB.

Dolutegravir and darunavir boosted with cobicistat are HIV medicines that people may take. They may also need to take medicines for an infection called latent tuberculosis (TB). Researchers think a once-weekly treatment for latent TB would be easier for people with HIV to take. This once weekly treatment consists of two drugs: rifapentine and isoniazid. However, they need to see how TB drugs and HIV drugs interact.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn how anti-HIV and anti-TB drugs affect each other so that people taking these drugs together can be treated safely.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHealthy adults ages 18 65.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have vital signs taken and give a blood sample. Women will have a pregnancy test.\n\nParticipants cannot take any other medicines during the study, including vitamins. Only occasional, infrequent use of acetaminophen (Tylenol , max 2000 mg/day), ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil ), naproxen (Aleve ), loperamide (Imodium ), and/or antihistamines (such as Benadryl , Zyrtec , Claritin , etc.) will be allowed.\n\nParticipants will be assigned to one of three groups. Each group will take a different study drug, once or twice a day, for 19 23 days. At the baseline study visit, they will get a supply of the study drug tablets and instructions for taking them. Participants will keep a medicine diary to serve as a memory aid for taking medicine and reporting any side effects that they may experience.\n\nParticipants will have 8 or 9 study visits over about 40 days. The number of visits depends on which group the person is assigned to. All visits will take place at the NIH Clinical Center. Participants will fast before study visits.\n\nThe baseline visit will last about 2 3 hours. There will be 3-4 long visits that will last for about 12 hours.

Although this regimen offers several potential benefits, the use of weekly RPT plus INH is not currently recommended in adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to limited evidence on drug interactions with antiretrovirals (ARVs).1Darunavir boosted with cobicistat (DRV/c) comprises part of alternative treatment regimens recommended for the treatment of HIV.2However, drug interactions between these ARV agents and RPT are of concern. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of concomitant RPT and INH administration on the steady state PK of DRV/c.\n\nThis is an open-label, fixed sequence, intrasubject drug-drug interaction study designed to evaluate the steady state PK of DRV/c with coadministration of once weekly RPT and INH given at doses used to treat LTBI. Arm B will be comprised of two phases: (1) DRV/c once daily alone (days 1-4) and (2) DRV/c once daily + (RPT and INH) once weekly (days 5-19). Participants in Arm B will undergo periodic serial ARV PK blood draws on days 4, 14, and 19.\n\nDRV/c PK parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods. Cobicistat levels will only be assessed if DRV concentrations are significantly decreased. The following PK parameters will be compared between phases: area under the curve over the dosing interval, maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, terminal half-life, apparent oral clearance, and minimum plasma concentration. Adverse events will be graded and recorded.	2016-06-03	2021-08-17	2021-08-17	2016-05-13	\N	2022-04-18	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 1"}	{"HIV Infected Population With Latent Tuberculosis"}	not included	cetirizine	Only in description because it may be taken during trial	f	HIV	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Martinson NA, Barnes GL, Moulton LH, Msandiwa R, Hausler H, Ram M, McIntyre JA, Gray GE, Chaisson RE.

One primary regulator of vasomotion and thus perfusion to the muscle tissue is the host of chemical factors originating from the vascular endothelium and the muscle tissue, which collectively sets the level of vascular tone. With advancing age and in many disease states, deleterious adaptations in the production and sensitivity of these vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances may be observed, leading to a reduction in skeletal muscle blood flow and compromised perfusion to the muscle tissue. Adequate perfusion is particularly important during exercise to meet the increased metabolic demand of the exercising tissue, and thus any condition that reduces tissue perfusion may limit the capacity for physical activity. As it is now well established that regular physical activity is a key component in maintaining cardiovascular health with advancing age, there is a clear need for further studies in populations where vascular dysfunction is compromised, with the goal of identifying the mechanisms responsible for the dysfunction and exploring whether these maladaptations may be remediable. Thus, to better understand the etiology of these vascular adaptations in health and disease, the current proposal is designed to study changes in vascular function with advancing age, and also examine peripheral vascular changes in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Sepsis, Pulmonary Hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. While there are clearly a host of vasoactive substances which collectively act to govern vasoconstriction both at rest and during exercise, four specific pathways that may be implicated have been identified in these populations: Angiotensin-II (ANG-II), Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Nitric Oxide (NO), and oxidative stress.	Parallel Assignment	Russell Richardson	OTHER	All	\N	18	420	Anticipated	OTHER	University of Utah	Non-Randomized	\N	None (Open Label)	\N	\N	Basic Science	\N	Angiotensin-II (ANG-II) is the end-product of the renin-angiotensin cascade, and acts as a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor through binding to the angiotensin receptor (AT1) on arteriolar vascular smooth muscle. With advancing age, there is a notable decline in plasma renin activity accompanied by decrements in circulating ANG-II and an increase in AT1 receptor density. However, the functional consequence of this age-related adaptation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on the peripheral circulation is not well understood. Likewise, in recent years it has become apparent that cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity in COPD, which may be related to vascular dysfunction and associated adoption of a sedentary lifestyle. In these patients, changes in RAS activity have been linked to peripheral vascular dysfunction, with compelling evidence for improvements in peripheral oxygen use following angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Like the aging population, systematic studies evaluating AT1 receptor sensitivity and the efficacy of AT1 receptor blockade on peripheral hemodynamics have not been undertaken.\n\nThe ubiquitous substance nitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as a key pathway for endothelium-dependent vasodilation, with the bioavailability of NO serving as an indicator for overall vascular health. Cardiac risk factors have been shown to cause impairment in endothelial vasodilator function in both the peripheral and coronary arteries. Coronary vascular dysfunction is an important phase in atherogenesis and is associated with myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, peripheral vascular function has been linked to coronary vascular dysfunction which could have important clinical implications in terms of health screening. Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been associated with the elderly, patients with COPD, and most cardiovascular diseases including pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure (HF), though the functional consequence of this adaptation on peripheral blood flow regulation remains unclear. Thus, we propose the use of a compound which inhibits the enzyme responsible for NO production in endothelial cells, N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), to temporarily block production of NO and thus determine the importance of this pathway at rest and during physical activity. Additionally, we propose the use of acetylcholine (Ach) to determine endothelial-dependent vasodilation and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and nitroglycerin (NTG) to determine the endothelial-independent vasodilation in the coronary arteries and the periphery. Oxidative stress associated with aging has been shown to reduce vascular function and antioxidant supplementation restores vascular function to levels that are indistinguishable from healthy young adults. The manner by which this improvement in vascular function occurs is not known by may be acting through a NO dependent mechanism.\n\nHistamine has been reported to mediate sustained post-exercise vasodilation through histamine-1 (H1) and histamine-2 (H2) receptor activity, which results in a ~50% elevation in femoral artery blood flow (above resting levels) that lasts for more than 100 minutes after a single bout of moderate-intensity dynamic exercise. Vasodilation can be markedly reduced by giving either fexofenadine (Allegra, a selective H1-receptor antagonist) or ranitidine (Zantac, a selective H2-receptor antagonist). The combination of H1/H2 blockade abolishes ~80% of the post-exercise vasodilation seen after whole-body exercise such as cycling and this observation has been observed in multiple studies in young sedentary, recreationally active, and endurance trained men and women. The impact of histamine on the post-exercise vasodilatory response is substantial; however, the role of H1/H2 receptors in regulating skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise is unknown. Thus, we intend to investigate the role of H1/H2 receptors in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood during exercise as this may be an important pathway in age and disease related reductions in blood flow during exercise.\n\nExercise training and rehabilitation can be used as an alternative approach to combat the deleterious effects oxidative stress on aging and disease. An effective exercise training intervention can decrease sympathetic nervous system activity, improve arterial compliance and vascular endothelial function, and alter the pro- and antioxidant balance resulting in improved endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms. Moreover, exercise training concomitantly improves musculoskeletal strength and function, glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function, body composition, blood chemistry (decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels), and overall well-being. The physiologic effect of an exercise rehabilitation program in diseases such as COPD, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is incompletely understood. However, recent studies suggest that exercise training in this patient population is well tolerated and associated with clinically significant physiologic improvements as well as improvements in various quality of life scores.\n\nA unique feature of the proposed studies identified herein is the inclusion of a novel methodological approach to comprehensively evaluate the functional outcome of the proposed pharmacologic interventions. The recent development of a unique combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques by members of our group enables near-simultaneous measurements of both muscle perfusion and metabolism in vivo. The arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique allows the measurement of both spatially and temporally resolved quantification of perfusion, while the kinetics of phosphocreatine (PCr) depletion and recovery provide high resolution measurements of muscle energetics. The interweaving of these imaging and spectroscopic modules provides the opportunity for determination of skeletal muscle perfusion and metabolism kinetics during and following the stress of physical exercise. Thus, this NMR-based approach, combined with direct measures of muscle fatigue, offers the potential to further define the individual and collective contribution of these variables to the attenuated limb blood flow in the elderly and in patients with COPD and PAH.\n\nWe propose that each of these pathways outlined above represent an avenue by which vascular function is compromised in the elderly and in patients with COPD, PAH and cardiovascular disease. However, because these pathways are not mutually exclusive, the proposed studies are designed to systematically evaluate hemodynamic responses to intra-arterial or intravenous administration of pharmacologic agents specific for the AT1 receptor (ANG-II and Diovan, AT1 agonist and antagonist, respectively), the Endothelin receptor Type-A (ETA receptor) (BQ-123, ETA antagonist), and the NO pathway (L-NMMA, Ach, and SNP) both before and after exercise training.	2008-09-01	2025-08-01	2025-08-01	2016-11-17	\N	2022-10-05	\N	University of Utah	Russell Richardson	Ph.D.	\N	\N	Sponsor-Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 1"}	{"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Pulmonary Artery Hypertension","Heart Failure",Hypertension}	pre-medication	fexofenadine	Catheter placement in femoral artery and femoral vein; resting measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and blood flow; flow mediated vasodilation test and exercise bouts at baseline and following treatment with Histamine H1 receptor antagonist fexofenadine (Allegra) and Histamine H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine (Zantac).	f	Vascular Function	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	fexofenadine

Ticagrelor is active as such and its hepatic metabolism by CYP3A generates also an active metabolite. Because of the remarkable progress in HIV therapies the number of older age patients is on the rise, requiring adequate cardiovascular treatment. Since frontline HIV therapies include ritonavir, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A enzyme, ticagrelor is contraindicated in these patients because of the expected interaction and bleeding risk. A lower efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel, which are both pro-drugs, in the presence of ritonavir has been already demonstrated. Therefore, administration of a lower dose of ticagrelor may be a good alternative in HIV patients in order to lessen the impact of this pharmacokinetic interaction. The aim of this study is to adjust the dose of ticagrelor in case of co-treatment with ritonavir to achieve the same pharmacokinetic profile as administered alone using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model.\n\nAs the first step, a pharmacokinetic (PK) model for ticagrelor and its active metabolite will be created based on available in vitro and in vivo parameters in healthy volunteers.\n\nAn open-label, 2 sessions cross over study will be conducted with 20 healthy male volunteers at Clinical Research Center (CRC) of Geneva University Hospitals (HUG). During the first session of the clinical trial, a single dose 180 mg ticagrelor will be administered to the volunteers and obtained pharmacokinetic data will be fitted into the model for optimization. Thereafter a simulated trial by the Simcyp® simulator in presence of a single dose 100 mg ritonavir will allow evaluating the impact of CYP3A inhibition on the concentration-time profile of ticagrelor and its active metabolite. The necessary dose of ticagrelor to minimize the magnitude of this interaction will be calculated. This new dose will be co-administered with ritonavir in the same volunteers during the second session of the clinical trial. The purpose is to obtain the same PK profile with single dose of 180 mg ticagrelor administered alone and with an adapted dose of ticagrelor co-administered with a single dose 100 mg ritonavir. Moreover, the pharmacodynamic effect of ticagrelor will be measured in both sessions of the clinical trial using two specific platelet function tests: the VAsodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein assay (VASP) and VerifyNow® P2Y12. With the same PK profile, the same pharmacodynamic activity is expected. The modulation of activity of CYP3A and P-gp by ritonavir will be also monitored using micro dose midazolam and fexofenadine as probe substrates.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to use the Simcyp® Simulator mechanistic PBPK modeling to broaden the application field of ticagrelor, especially in HIV patients. Since PK models are often created after clinical observations, the prospective aspect of this study is of particular value as the model will be first created and then applied to an unknown clinical scenario.

The aims of this 3-armed, randomised controlled trial are to investigate whether acupuncture plus rescue medication is non-inferior (closed testing procedure: in case of success in non-inferiority: test of superiority) to minimal acupuncture plus rescue medication in the treatment of SAR (closed testing procedure: closed testing procedure: in case of success in non-inferiority: test of superiority), and whether acupuncture plus rescue medication is non-inferior to rescue medication alone consisting only of oral antihistamines for this indication. The trial interventions will be performed in approximately 40 outpatient centres in Germany. In total, 400 patients with SAR will be randomised to one of three groups: acupuncture plus rescue medication, minimal acupuncture (i.e. superficial needling at non-acupuncture points) plus rescue medication, or rescue medication only. Rescue medication will consist of oral antihistamines. Acupuncture and minimal acupuncture will be administered by physicians specialised in acupuncture and will consist of 12 sessions per patient in the first 8 weeks. Patients in the rescue medication group will receive 12 sessions of acupuncture after 8 weeks. The primary outcome measures will be the mean of Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score (RQLQ scores between weeks 6 and 8 of the first year (adjusted for baseline values) and the Rescue Medication Score (RMS) between weeks 6 and 8 of the first year (adjusted for baseline values).	2008-04-01	2011-04-01	2011-04-01	2008-02-08	\N	2012-10-23	\N	Charite University, Berlin, Germany	Benno Brinkhaus	Prof. MD	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Child,Adult}	{"Not Applicable"}	{"Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis"}	rescue medication	cetirizine	\N	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Adam D, Grabenhenrich L, Ortiz M, Binting S, Reinhold T, Brinkhaus B.

The development of a personalized medicine in psychiatry may reduce treatment failure, intolerance or resistance, and hence burden and costs of affective disorders.\n\nThere is hope that biomarkers will be found to guide treatment selection. It might be of decisive interest to be able to assess an individual's metabolism activity.

Parallel Assignment	Hamad Medical Corporation	INDUSTRY	All	14	0.25	210	Anticipated	INDUSTRY	Hamad Medical Corporation	Randomized	\N	Single	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	Anaphylaxis is an acute serious allergic reaction, with multi-organ system manifestations caused by the release of chemical mediators . It requires immediate recognition and intervention.\n\nThe estimated rate of anaphylaxis in children was 10.5 per 100,000 persons-years . Although the Rochester Epidemiology Project showed a rate of 75.1 per 100,000 person-years in children aged 9 years and 65.2 per 100,000 person-years in children aged 10-19-years old.\n\nIn the state of Qatar with approximately 280,000 visits annually to Pediatric Emergency Center (PEC), there were 171 cases of anaphylaxis seen at the facility from September 2015 to September 2016.\n\nAnaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis based on typical systemic manifestations, due to exposure to a causative agent. There are many possible triggers, including food, medication, insect venoms, rubber latex and vaccines . In some individuals, anaphylaxis is idiopathic. Both IgE and non-IgE activation of mast cells and basophils that results in the release and production of several inflammatory and vasoactive substances, these substances most commonly involve the skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. As a result, urticarial, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, increased vascular permeability and decreased vascular tone.\n\nAnaphylaxis involves a range of signs and symptoms from hives, wheezing and angioedema to cardiovascular collapse and death [9,10]. More than 80% of the patients will present with flushing, itching, hives, angioedema, or other skin or mucosal symptoms. Generally up to 70%, at least 2 organ systems (skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal systems) are involved; however, only 10-45% have cardiovascular symptoms, including chest pain, hypotension, or shock . Between 5% and 14% of patients may experience a recurrence of anaphlactoid reaction 8-12 hours after the initial presentation, called Biphasic (late-phase) . Most of these reactions are mild or moderate . Risk factors for biphasic reactions include a severe initial reaction; presence of laryngeal edema or hypotension; delay in the administration of adrenaline (epinephrine); too small a dose of adrenaline; and a history of a previous biphasic reaction . Delayed symptoms can develop despite treatment .\n\nThe mainstay of treatment for children experiencing anaphylaxis remains adrenaline 1:1000 intramuscularly (IM) . H1-antihistamines are also commonly administered in anaphylaxis. The combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines appears to be more effective, especially for cutaneous symptoms . The onset of activity of these agents is slower than epinephrine and is considered next-in-line treatment.\n\nInternational guidelines consider antihistamines and glucocorticoids as second-line . Corticosteroids are not life-saving and do not have an immediate effect on the symptoms of anaphylaxis, since it takes 4-6 hours to work.\n\nGlucocorticoids are administered to 50% of individuals with anaphylaxis, despite a lack of compelling evidence supporting their use.\n\nRecent retrospective study in emergency department, evaluated the association between glucocorticoids administration and prolonged length of stay. In 4years retrospective chart review study on anaphylaxis patient, 70% of study patients received glucocorticoids as part of their treatment. Glucocorticoids were not found to reduce follow up revisit in the three days post discharge. And it didn't decrease the likelihood of extra epinephrine need for flare of symptoms, and only found to decrease length of stay in severe anaphylaxis.\n\nThe existing evidence for the use of glucocorticoids appears to consist mainly of retrospective studies, case reports, and other descriptive literature. The need exists, however, for a prospective study on the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of anaphylaxis and its effectiveness in prevention of biphasic reaction. The objective of the current study, therefore, is to complement the current research on anaphylaxis and to investigate if glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis and if it can prevent or limit biphasic reaction.\n\nThis will be the first randomized controlled trial to look at steroid use in anaphylaxis and its impact on anaphylaxis treatment on a prospective fashion which will be used to help standardize care in the use of steroid for this common condition.	2018-04-15	2022-04-01	2022-09-01	2018-05-14	\N	2021-08-31	\N	Hamad Medical Corporation	DR.

Inform consents then were signed before the beginning of the experiment.\n\nThe volunteer would be in a research process during their first 1-2 hours in emergency department, with the follow up time at 1 week and 1 month\n\nAfter the investigator complete the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the participants would be random into 3 groups. The randomization process would already be prepared into 3 groups with a number coding by the statistician who doesn't get involve in the rest of experiment. The drugs would be in the 3 group of sealed envelopes which have 3 kinds of drug combination :\n\nControl group : Chlorpheniramine 10 mg/amp ; 1 ampule and cetirizine 10 mg 7 tabs\nExperiment group : Chlorpheniramine 10 mg/amp ; 1 ampule, Dexamethasone 5 mg/amp; 1 ampule and cetirizine 10 mg 7 tabs\nExperiment group : Chlorpheniramine 10 mg/amp ; 1 ampule, Dexamethasone 5 mg/amp; 1 ampule, cetirizine 10 mg 7 tabs, and prednisolone 5 mg 20 tabs After the envelopes are sealed, it will be code in an order of number. All of the enrolled patients will get Chlorpheniramine 10 mg intravenous. The patients who are assigned in experiment group will get an additional Dexamethasone 5 mg intravenous. The preparation of both drugs will be result to be a 10 ml of clear fluid. The control group will get a 10 ml of sterile fluid in 10 ml syringe as a placebo. The drugs will be prepared and delivered be the nurse who knows about the research process but does not get involved in other process of the research.\n\nAfter the experiment period in emergency department, all of the enrolled patients will get cetirizine 10 mg 7 tabs as a home medication. One experiment group will get prednisolone 5 mg 20 tabs. They will be appointed to an outpatient department in 1 week and 1 month for the follow up of an acute urticarial rash.\n\nSample size calculation Investigators do the hypothesis that the experiment groups who get both Chlorpheniramine 10 mg and Dexamethasone 5 mg intravenous would have the itch score decrease at least 2 points so this experiment wants minimal clinical difference at "2". This number got from our expert in immunology and skin disease. The standard deviation for this experiment is 2.1 from the previous research. Calculated by G*Power version 3.1 (Dusseldorf, Germany) for an independent t-test , two-tailed analysis, alpha error probability = 0.05 and power of analysis (1-beta error probability) = 0.90 The sample size for each group is 23 persons so the patients enroll in this research would be 69 persons.\n\nData Collection\n\nSex and age\nTime since the first rash erupt before coming to emergency department (hrs)\n%body surface area of rash involved\nUrticarial activity score (UAS) before and after treatment\nItch score (Visual analog scale (VAS) score) by letting the patients mark a cross on a straight line.

Patients with HIV infection often take herbal products and dietary supplements in addition to their doctor-prescribed medicines to treat the disease, lessen the side effects of anti-viral drugs, and improve their overall well being. Alternative medicines such as these may, however, interfere with the elimination of lopinavir/ritonavir from the body, causing either higher or lower blood levels of these drugs than would be expected. This study will assess in healthy subjects any potential harms of taking echinacea, ginseng, or ginkgo biloba together with lopinavir/ritonavir.\n\nHealthy normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a history, physical examination, and blood tests, including an HIV test and a pregnancy test for women. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center after fasting overnight for the following procedures:\n\nVisits 1 and 2: A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein to collect blood samples. After the first sample is drawn, the subject takes 8 mg of midazolam syrup and two fexofenadine tablets. Midazolam is a sedative, and fexofenadine (Allegra) is a medicine used to treat allergies. Subjects are given breakfast an hour after taking the drugs. Blood samples are collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 24 hours after taking the drugs to measure blood levels of fexofenadine. An extra sample is collected at the 4-hour mark to measure the midazolam level. The catheter is removed after the 8-hour blood draw and subjects are dismissed home. They return the following morning (visit 2) for the 24-hour blood draw.\n\nVisit 3: From 7 to 28 days after visit 1, subjects begin taking lopinavir/ritonavir capsules twice a day by mouth for a total of 29.5 days. On day 15 they return to the clinic for lopinavir/ritonavir blood levels as were done for fexofenadine, except that samples are collected once before breakfast and then at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the lopinavir/ritonavir dose. An extra sample is collected for routine tests. The catheter is removed after the 12-hour draw and the subject is dismissed home.\n\nThe next morning, subjects begin taking one of the following: echinacea 500 mg 3 times a day; ginkgo biloba 120 mg twice a day; or ginseng 500 mg 3 times a day for 28 days.\n\nVisit 4: On the last day of taking lopinavir/ritonavir, subjects return to the clinic again for blood level measurements of these drugs as on visit 3, except that the catheter is removed and the subject dismissed home after the 8-hour blood draw.\n\nVisits 5 and 6: On the last day of taking the herbal supplement, subjects return to the clinic for repeat measurement of fexofenadine and midazolam levels, as described in visits 1 and 2. At the final visit (visit 6) an additional blood sample is collected for repeat laboratory testing.\n\n...	Crossover Assignment	National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC)	NIH	All	50	18	47	Actual	NIH	National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC)	Randomized	\N	None (Open Label)	\N	\N	\N	\N	Patients with HIV commonly use herbal products and dietary supplements in addition to medications prescribed by their physicians. Up to 73% of patients with HIV have reported using some form of complementary or alternative medicine. As such, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions between herbs and antiretrovirals is becoming increasingly appreciated. Despite this awareness, little is known about the effect of commonly used herbal products, such as echinacea, ginkgo biloba, and ginseng, on antiretroviral pharmacokinetics. Interacting herbal supplements have the potential to alter protease inhibitor (PI) plasma concentrations, as has been shown with St. John's Wort and garlic. Drug interactions may potentially increase antiretroviral concentrations, putting patients at risk for toxicities, or lower drug concentrations below the threshold of viral susceptibility, putting patients in jeopardy of antiretroviral failure. The protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir both rely principally on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolism for their elimination. In addition, both drugs are substrates for the transport protein p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also contribute to their distribution and elimination.\n\nThe primary purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the herbal supplements Echinacea purpurea, ginkgo biloba, and Panax ginseng alter the pharmacokinetic properties of the HIV protease inhibitor (PI) lopinavir, administered as the PI combination lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). This is an open label pharmacokinetic study that will be performed on an outpatient basis. A total of 42 study participants who have met inclusion criteria will be sequentially divided into one of 3 groups, such that 14 subjects each will receive LPV/r alone and in combination with either E. purpurea, G. biloba, or P. ginseng.\n\nSubjects will begin taking LPV/r (400mg/100mg twice daily x 29.5 days), returning to the NIH on Day 15 of dosing for post-dose plasma collection and determination of lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations. On Day 16 participants will begin taking either E. purpurea (500mg, three times daily), G. biloba extract (120 mg, twice daily), or P. ginseng (500 mg, twice daily) for 28 days. On the 30th day of LPV/r (Day 15 of the herb), subjects will return to the NIH where they will take their final LPV/r dose and then have their plasma collected for determination of lopinavir concentrations. Data from this investigation will determine whether echinacea, ginseng, or ginkgo biloba supplements alter the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir.	2005-01-01	2011-01-01	2011-06-01	2005-02-07	2012-04-16	2012-04-16	National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center, Department of Pharmacy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 4"}	{Healthy}	minimal	fexofenadine	fex only as comparison and probe for blood level\nTodo usecase	f	Pharmacokinetics	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{"Fairfield KM, Eisenberg DM, Davis RB, Libman H, Phillips RS.

This practical organization allows the elimination of emotional biases correlated with the outcome. In case of a negative beta-hCG, the patient will be scheduled for a second IVF/ICSI cycle after a washout (W) period (between 2 and 6 months). In the second cycle, the patient will undergo, during the luteal phase, the opposite treatment (V or S). Also in this case, the survey for evaluating the level of satisfaction will be administered on the day of beta-hCG, with the same modalities of the first cycle. The domains of the surveys are focused on facility of the administration, comfort, level of complaint, side effects, overall level of satisfaction.\n\nThe sequence S-V or V-S will be randomly assigned (random assignment) with the concealment of the allocation.\n\nIn case of a negative beta-hCG also in the second cycle, a post-hoc comparison between the two treatments will be carried out through a Semantic Differential Scale, in the "follow-up" phase.	2016-12-20	2019-12-01	2019-12-01	2017-06-09	\N	2020-01-10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	27 couples were recruited.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Giving chemotherapy together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether treatment with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating patients who have undergone surgery for colon cancer.

Completed	The asthmatic airway is identified and studied using inhaled agents such as histamine and methacholine. The use of antihistamines prior to the test will inhibit the test result if histamine is used to cause airway constriction. If using methacholine, this may also be true depending on whether old (e.g. benadryl) or new (e.g. desloratadine) antihistamines are used. This study will look at the effect of old and new antihistamines on inhaled methacholine challenge response in individuals with mild asthma.

Only two very recently small-scaled studies evaluate the effect of pregabalin for UP. However, both these studies were not randomized, placebo-controlled trails.\n\nStudies focusing on the treatment of UP were limited and no studies comparing the efficacy between pregabalin and antihistamine, most widely used for the therapy of UP currently, were conducted. Additionally. there were few studies investigating the effect of the drugs used for UP on the QoL outcomes, though UP has a great impact on the patients' QoL. As UP is still one of the most vexing and disabling symptoms in patients with ESRD, we decided to do this multicenter, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) with a larger sample size and a longer duration.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo investigate the efficacy and the safety of pregabalin, as compared with fexofenadine and placebo, in the treatment of uremic pruritus.\n\nMethods:\n\nThis is a multicenter RCT. Haemodialysis patients with established UP were enrolled from multiple medical centers in Taiwan. All patients will be randomly allocated to receive one of three treatments -pregabalin 75mg daily, fexofenadine 60 mg daily, or placebo-for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is the change in the visual analogue score and pruritus score. The changes in QoL measures, including Skindex-10, Brief Itching Inventory and Itch Medical Outcomes Study, are also assessed before, during and after therapy. Safety is assessed at all visits throughout the study.

The prevalence of acute urticaria in life is about 15 to 20% in the general population. It is responsible for a frequent use of emergency departments (ED). The usual treatment is based on early administration of an association of antihistamines and corticosteroid. The therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids has never been established by high evidence studies. However, corticosteroids are frequently used. When stopped, corticosteroids could promote the occurence of urticaria recurrences, and a transition to chronic urticaria. In addition, corticosteroids may be rarely responsible for gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension and diabetes.	2019-09-21	2022-03-28	2023-09-21	2018-06-04	\N	2022-12-09	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 3"}	{Urticaria,Angiœdema}	comparison	levocetirizine	comparison or main?	f	Urticaria	2022-09-15 18:58:14	{"Javaud N, Soria A, Maignan M, Martin L, Descamps V, Fain O, Bouillet L, Berard F, Tazarourte K, Roy PM, Fontaine JP, Bagot M, Khellaf M, Goulet H, Lapostolle F, Casalino E, Doutre MS, Gil-Jardine C, Caux F, Chosidow O, Pateron D, Vicaut E, Adnet F.

It consists of the administration of probe substances metabolised by a specific cytochrome or transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) for example, followed by the determination of a metabolic ratio or the evaluation of the plasmatic or urinary concentrations of the probe substances. The administration of a cocktail containing several probe substances allows the simultaneous evaluation of the activity of several cytochromes and P-gp in a single test.\n\nWhen a cocktail approach is used it is important to make sure that no drug-drug interactions occur between the probes within the cocktail. The validation of the lack of interactions, which is the aim of the study, consists of demonstrating that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters and/or metabolic ratios when a probe is administered alone or as part of the cocktail. The Geneva cocktail consists of caffeine, bupropion, flurbiprofen, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam and fexofenadine for the simultaneous phenotyping of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CAP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-gp, respectively.\n\nProbe and metabolite concentrations will be measured in capillary blood using a dried blood spot (DBS) analysis. To further facilitate sampling, a new simple device will be used to ensure the precision of capillary blood collection.

Parkinson Under Consideration of Quality of Life Parameters and Cognitive Function	PIRLONG-PD Safety and Efficacy of Piribedil in Parkinson's Disease During Long Term Therapy	Completed	Non-Ergot Dopamine agonists are meanwhile the drugs of first-choice in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The receptor profile of the non-ergot dopamine-agonist piribedil is unique. In addition to agonistic effects on dopaminergic D2- and D3-receptors piribedil has adrenergic alpha-2A- and alpha-2C-receptors antagonisic properties. There is evidence from the literature that the antagonistic properties of piribedil are correlated with an improvement of cognitive function and vigilance parameters in parkinson's disease. The aim of the present non-interventional study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of piribedil during long-term therapy of patients with M. Parkinson under consideration of cognitive functions and quality of life.	\N	Desitin Arzneimittel GmbH	INDUSTRY	All	\N	18	908	Actual	INDUSTRY	Desitin Arzneimittel GmbH	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Prospective	\N	2009-06-01	2014-12-01	2015-02-01	2012-01-27	\N	2016-01-29	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Observational	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{}	{"Parkinson's Disease"}	not included	loratadine	Clarium	f	Parkinson	2022-08-17 18:44:47	{"Castro-Caldas A, Delwaide P, Jost W, Merello M, Williams A, Lamberti P, Aguilar M, Del Signore S, Cesaro P; Parkinson-Control Study Group.

This study will determine whether taking a drug called omalizumab (also known as Xolair) before getting the allergy shots is more effective than allergy shots alone or other treatments, such as prescription antihistamines.

Allergy symptoms, which can range from mild to seriously debilitating, may affect quality of life. Left untreated, allergic rhinitis can exacerbate or trigger more serious conditions, such as asthma and sinus inflammation.\n\nIndividuals with allergies react to harmless particles such as dust or pollen. Proteins in the blood called IgE antibodies treat the harmless particles as invaders and trigger an immune system response. The immune response results in harmful inflammation of healthy tissues. In ragweed allergy, inflammation occurs in the airways and causes familiar allergy symptoms like sneezing, coughing, and general discomfort.\n\nOmalizumab is an investigational drug that has been shown to block the effects of IgE antibodies. The blocking effect of omalizumab is temporary, but giving the drug to people before their regular allergy shots may make the shots more effective.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive injections of omalizumab or a placebo before an accelerated course of allergy shots (given over 12 weeks). The participants will return for follow-up for up to one year, and they may have as many as 27 study visits.	2003-04-01	2005-05-01	2005-05-01	2004-02-20	\N	2016-10-18	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 2"}	{"Hay Fever",Hypersensitivity,Allergy,Rhinitis}	rescue medication	fexofenadine	\N	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{"Nayak A, Casale T, Miller SD, Condemi J, McAlary M, Fowler-Taylor A, Della Cioppa G, Gupta N.

Cetirizine is a second-generation selective antihistamine widely used in an oral formulation for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Local administration of cetirizine has been shown to reduce symptoms after allergen challenge, and has the potential to shorten the time to onset and decrease systemic side effects. However, local irritation and nasal burning/pain has been reported after nasal administration. For the compliance of the patients taking a nasal spray, the taste and tolerance of the product is of particular importance. NLA Nasal Spray contains cetirizine in a liposomal formulation aiming to improve the tolerability. The present study aims to compare the NLA Nasal Spray with cetirizine in an aqueous formulation and placebo with regard to taste perversion and local tolerance.

It consists of the administration of probe substances metabolised by a specific cytochrome or transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) for example, followed by the determination of a metabolic ratio or the evaluation of the plasmatic or urinary concentrations of the probe substances. The administration of a cocktail containing several probe substances allows the simultaneous evaluation of the activity of several cytochromes and P-gp in a single test.\n\nThe aim of this project is the validation of a phenotyping cocktail of low dose probe drugs for the assessment of cytochrome P450 and P-gp activities by simple capillary blood sampling and dried blood spot (DBS) analysis. The cocktail consists of caffeine, bupropion, flurbiprofen, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam and fexofenadine for the simultaneous phenotyping of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CAP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-gp, respectively.\n\nThe modulation of the activity of cytochromes or P-gp will be evaluated by the administration of inhibitors (fluvoxamine, voriconazole, quinidine) or inducer (rifampicin) of the metabolic pathways or the P-gp mediated transport.

Patients have relapses (also known as attacks) which are often quite severe and leave them with significant disability. Without treatment, within 5 years 50% of NMO patients are blind in one or both eyes or require walking assistance (cane, walker or wheelchair).\n\nNMO has only been relatively recently described and is fairly rare. Most NMO patients' immune systems produce abnormal antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is found in certain cells in the central nervous system. When these AQP4 antibodies bind to AQP4, they trigger a cascade of events involving the immune system which eventually leads to damage to the nervous system. This ultimately leads to disability, some of which is permanent.\n\nUntil now, treatments for NMO have been mostly focused on decreasing production of this AQP4 antibody. However, recent experiments in animal models of NMO have shown the importance of what happens inside the central nervous system after the antibody binds to the nervous system cell. Specifically, researchers have noted the importance of a specific cell type, eosinophils, in causing damage in NMO lesions. In a recent study, researchers showed they could prevent damage from NMO by blocking eosinophils using cetirizine, which is a popular over-the-counter allergy medicine.\n\nCetirizine is already known to be safe and well-tolerated in the general population. In this study, the researchers plan to add cetirizine on to patients' current NMO treatment. The researchers aim to show that it is safe, well-tolerated, and that with cetirizine, NMO patients have less relapses and therefore less disability over the course of the year following initiation of treatment. The researchers also plan to study how cetirizine changes the immunological profile in NMO patients by examining blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

Histamine is an important chemical mediator of inflammation in asthma. The benefits of antihistamine treatment in patients with mild to moderate asthma have been well documented, however their clinical use has been previously limited due to the high doses required for efficacy and their associated side effects including sedation and cognitive impairment.\n\nRecent evidence indicates that in addition to H1-receptor antagonism, some of the newer nonsedating, non-impairing antihistamines appear to possess various anti-inflammatory properties at concentrations achieved at therapeutic dosages suggesting an additional benefit of these drugs in the management of allergic diseases and asthma.

The parent compound, cetirizine was shown to be effective against experimental dermatographism, however no study has been conducted so far on the effect of levocetirizine on the inhibition of dermatographism. It is known that cetirizine is a mast-cell stabilizer and decreases histamine levels and the number of tryptase positive mast cells. Cetirizine inhibits the production of interleukin 8 (IL8) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by immune cells - two potent chemoattractants - and induces the release from monocytes of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a suppressor of antigen presentation and MHC class II expression. However, the effects of the most active enantiomer levocetirizine on these inflammatory mediators have not been evaluated so far. Therefore, we aim to conduct a study in humans with dermatographism and chronic idiopathic urticaria to evaluate the effect of levocetirizine on the above-mentioned mediators. The study will involve the use of skin microdialysis, a minimally invasive technique to measure inflammatory mediators in the extracellular space in dermis.	\N	Wake Forest University	OTHER	All	60	18	11	Actual	OTHER	Wake Forest University Health Sciences	\N	\N	\N	\N	Case-Crossover	\N	Cross-Sectional	\N	2009-04-01	2010-08-01	2010-09-01	2009-11-06	\N	2017-02-28	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	Mediators of interest were not consistently detectable with the analytical methods employed.

Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin is the current standard of care (SOC), which can slow-down disease. Plasma major histamine metabolite (Methylimidazoleacetic acid [MIAA]) is increased in LAM. Loratadine is a histamine receptor antagonist (HR1), which inhibits LAM cell proliferation. Therefore, a novel phase-II clinical trial for assessing safety and potential benefits of loratadine in LAM has been initiated.\n\nMETHODS: LORALAM clinical trial, phase-II, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study initiates recruitment in July 2020. Enrollment plan includes 62 subjects with LAM on treatment with rapamycin ≥3 months, randomized 1:1 to add oral loratadine 10mg/day or placebo, once daily, for 52 weeks. Recruitment will end in June 2021. The primary endpoints are 1) to assess the safety profile of loratadine associated with rapamycin, 2) lung function decline after 52 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints are a) quality of life and progression free-survival time, b) changes in the established LAM serum biomarker VEGFD, c) the utility of MIAA for monitoring disease progression and biological treatment effect.\n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, Declaration of Helsinki principles, and each ethical committee. This clinical trial contemplates the possibility of increasing the number of centers and including patients from patient support groups (LAM foundation, AELAM)	Parallel Assignment	Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge	OTHER	All	\N	18	62	Anticipated	OTHER	Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge	Randomized	\N	Triple	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare and lethal lung disease affecting almost exclusively women of childbearing age and characterized by progressive cystic lung destruction. LAM results from germline and somatic loss-of-function mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 genes (TSC1/2), and therefore diseased cells show abnormal activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) is the current standard of care. However, this therapy does not fully kill LAM cells, shows variable tolerability and treatment answer. Therefore, sirolimus has slowed-down disease progression but young patients still need lung transplantation despite treatment. In addition, LAM diagnosis and clinical monitoring is also challenging due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and insufficiency of non-invasive tests. Here, guided by comprehensive preclinical data obtained in the context of a Spanish research network for LAM, and with the support of the national Association of LAM patients (AELAM), the investigators propose a phase-II clinical trial for assessing if the tricyclic antihistamine loratadine is effective in slowing the progression of lung disease in LAM. Loratadine is an histamine receptor 1 (HR1) antagonist, widely used for allergic process, that also acts through different intracellular signaling, including Akt/MITF and PKCBII-tyrosine kinase. Recent studies have demonstrated that co-treatment with loratadine sensitize KBV20C resistant cells to vincristine, which improve the onco-therapeutical effect. The primary study objective is to assess the safety profile of loratadine 10 mg/day associated with the current standard treatment (sirolimus) and its potential benefit abrogating the lung function decline after 52 weeks of treatment. The secondary objectives include; a) an assessment of quality of life and progression free-survival time, and, b) to determine the clinical usefulness of the major histamine-derived metabolite methylimidazoleacetic acid (MIAA) for monitoring of disease progression and biological treatment effect.	2021-11-01	2022-12-30	2023-12-30	2022-01-13	\N	2022-01-27	\N	Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge	Maria Molina	Chief of Interstitial Lung Diseases Unit, Respiratory Department.

Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (eg montelukast) are the latest class of inflammation-modulating asthma drugs and appear to cause fewer long-term side effects than systemic corticosteroids and reduce the need for shorter-acting bronchodilator reliever medicines. However variability in response between patients has been observed and clinical experience with these agents is still limited.\n\nHistamine is an important chemical mediator of inflammation in asthma. The benefits of antihistamine treatment in patients with mild to moderate asthma have been well documented, however their clinical use has been previously limited due to the high doses required for efficacy and their associated side effects including sedation and cognitive impairment. Recent evidence indicates that in addition to H1-receptor antagonism, some of the newer nonsedating, non-impairing antihistamines appear to possess various anti-inflammatory properties at concentrations achieved at therapeutic dosages suggesting an additional benefit of these drugs in the management of allergic diseases and asthma. The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety performance of fexofenadine compared to montelukast in subjects with asthma.	2002-02-01	2003-11-01	2003-11-01	2002-09-19	\N	2008-08-21	\N	\N	\N	\N	ICD Study Director	sanofi-aventis	\N	\N	Interventional	{Child,Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 3"}	{Asthma}	comparison	fexofenadine	comparison to montelukast	t	Asthma	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	fexofenadine

Despite considerable advances in the diagnosis and treatment of asthma over the past several years, a sizeable portion of patients do not respond to the "core" treatments. The investigators are now learning that the underlying pathophysiology of disease is different among patients with asthma therefore; treatments which are beneficial in some patient groups may be not achieve affect in other groups.\n\nAntihistamines have been studied in the past for the treatment of asthma. These studies have shown that there may be a beneficial effect of antihistamines in patients with allergic asthma where histamine likely plays a large role in disease and treatment response. However, there is not enough evidence to include these drugs in the standard treatment of asthma.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that histamine plays a definable, significant role in disease pathogenesis and treatment response in children with allergic asthma. The investigators plan to test this overall hypothesis through two specific aims. The first aim will characterize the relative contribution of histamine in allergic vs. non-allergic asthma. This aim will be accomplished by comparison of the microvasculature response to histamine in children with allergic asthma and children with non-allergic asthma, measured by histamine iontophoresis with laser Doppler (HILD) monitoring, to determine potential phenotype-associated differences in the pharmacodynamic response to histamine.

Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks tumor growth by disrupting DNA and RNA synthesis and repair (cell division and survival). Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the ability of tumors to grow and spread by inhibiting the growth of blood vessels that feed them. Patients with colorectal cancer can develop a resistance to the effects of bevacizumab. Levocetirizine may decrease tumor resistance to bevacizumab. Giving bevacizumab, capecitabine, and levocetirizine dihydrochloride together may be an effective treatment for refractory colorectal cancer.

There will be minimum of five total study visits. The study drug will be encapsulated with methylcellulose and the placebo capsules will have methylcellulose alone.\n\nVisit Schedule:\n\nInitial Screening Visit On a regularly scheduled clinic day, following completion of a signed informed consent the study, the first patient evaluation will compose of: '\n\nHistory and Physical Exam The subject's demographic, medical, family, and history will be recorded by standardized questionnaire. All previous medications used to treat allergic rhinitis will be recorded.\n\nSkin prick testing using the Multi-test method will be used to test for common environmental allergens. This is a standard procedure done in evaluating patients with a clinical history suggestive of allergic rhinitis and takes 15 minutes from initial prick to interpretation of results.\n\nAs part of the standard assessment for skin testing, patients will be asked to not take any oral or intranasal anti-histamines for one week before the visit. Antihistamines can mask the histamine effects, and subsequently positive skin test results. If they are interested in participating in the study, they will be asked to remain off antihistamines until their enrollment into the study has been determined. Allergens on the environmental panel to be tested include cat, dust mite, weed mix, tree mix, grass mix, mold mix, saline, and histamine.\n\nSecond Screening Visit\n\nAfter withholding beta-agonist treatment for at least 6 hours, testing for baseline pulmonary function will be performed with impulse oscillometry and spirometry. They will undergo impulse oscillometry technique under the guidance of a trained technician. If the subject is.able to, he/she will also perform spirometry after oscillometry is completed. If airway obstruction is detected by oscillometry, subjects will be given levalbuterol by hand-held nebulizer and both impulse oscillometry and spirometry will be repeated 15 minutes after the nebulizer treatment is completed. If there is evidence of reversibility (i.e. lung function improvement), then the subject will have fulfilled the inclusion criteria and be asked to continue with the study.\n\nFirst Study Visit The first study visit will be a continuation of the second screening visit after the subject has fulfilled the inclusion criteria as evidenced by reversible airway obstruction following levalbuterol treatment. The subject will be asked to continue with the study period and he/she will have repeat lung function testing at 15, 30, 60,90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after treatment. Lung function testing will be by impulse oscillometry. If the subject is able to, he/she will perform spirometry at 60 and 240 minutes post-levalbuterol.\n\nSubjects will be instructed to complete a daily diary for allergic rhinitis and asthma symptom scores.\n\nSecond Study Visit (1 to 7 days after First Study Visit) All beta-agonist treatment needs to be withheld at least 6 hours prior to the visit. Baseline lung function testing by impulse oscillometry and spirometry will be done. The subject will be given Cetirizine 10 mg tablet or placebo. The subject and the coordinator will be blinded to the study treatment. Lung function testing will be assessed by impulse oscillometry. at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after the cetirizine. Spirometry will also be performed at 60 and 240 minutes post.-cetirizine .\n\nDaily diary entries will be reviewed with the subject. The subject will be sent home on the study medication. He/she take 1 tablet of the study medication daily starting the day after the study visit.\n\nThird Study Visit (7 to 10 days after Second Study Visit) The subject will take his/her usual study medication dose in the office. He/she will perform impulse oscillometry, and if able to, spirometry to assess lung function. Daily diary entries will be reviewed with subject. The subject will be instructed to continue taking the study medication at the same dosing regimen.\n\nFourth Study Visit ,(7 to 10 days after Third Study Visit)\n\nThe subject will take his/her usual study medication dose in the office. He/she will perform impulse oscillometry and spirometry to assess lung function. Daily diary entries will be reviewed with the subject. The subject will be instructed to stop taking the study medication and continue putting in diary entries.\n\nFifth Study Visit (7 to 10 days after Fourth Study Visit) The subject will perform impulse oscillometry and spirometry to assess lung function.

Efficacy of colchicine which is the first line drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of gout flare varies and only half of treated patients experience good response. This study aims to optimize colchicine prescription for the treatment and prophylaxis of gout flare.\n\nCurrent data suggest that efficiency of colchicine relies on its maximum blood concentration (Cmax).\n\nIn this study, the investigators hypothesize that responders to colchicine treatment have higher colchicine Cmax than non-responder patients following the recommended dose regimen (1 mg then 0.5 mg 1 hour later).\n\nThe individual pharmacokinetics (PK) of colchicine remains poorly investigated while the assessment of individual drug metabolisms can be performed.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study stands that several factors contribute to the variability of colchicine Cmax. The analysis of individual PK profile and a well-characterized metabolism of colchicine will permit a personalized treatment regimen for the treatment and prophylaxis of gout flares.

Previous study suggests that colchicine efficiency relies on its blood maximum concentration (Cmax) (PMID 20131255). However this hypothesis needs to be confirmed.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study stands that colchicine Cmax varies with individual colchicine pharmacokinetics and that this individual variation may explain the variation response of colchicine treatment.\n\nAbsorption of orally administrated colchicine varies between 24 et 88% with an average of 45%. Thus, following oral administration of 1.8 mg colchicine over 1 hour to healthy young adults, under fasting condition, the colchicine Cmax (mean 6.2 ng/ml) is reached within a median of 1.8 hours (range 1.0-2.5) (PMID 20131255).\n\nColchicine is demethylated to two metabolites, 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine (2- and 3-DMC, respectively). In vitro studies have shown that hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is involved in the metabolism of colchicine to 2- and 3-DMC. Colchicine is also a substrate of liver and intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter.\n\nColchicine is eliminated in urine and stools. 40-65% of orally administrated colchicine is recovered unchanged in urine. Enterohepatic recirculation and biliary excretion account for around 50% of colchicine elimination. The mean half-live elimination is 20 to 40 hours.\n\nThus, blood concentration of colchicine depends on kidney and hepatic functions, intestinal absorption and secretion, the presence of drug-drug interactions and individual characteristics of CYP3A4 and P-gp activities (PMID 21480191).\n\nThe individual CYP3A4 and P-gp activities can be assessed with specific probe and/or substrate of these proteins in the so-called phenotyping assay. Thus, using micro dose of midazolam and fexofenadine the activity of CYP3A4 and P-gp, respectively, can be determined and subsequently the individual pharmacokinetic profile of colchicine characterized (PMID 24722393).\n\nCYP3A4 activity is given by the ratio of hydroxy-midazolam/midazolam assessed 2 hours after an oral administration of 1 mg midazolam (PMID 24722393).\n\nP-gp activity is given by the area under the curve (AUC) of a short kinetic that measures fexofenadine concentrations at 2, 3 and 6 hours after its oral administration of 120 mg (PMID 24722393).\n\nThese CYP3A4 and P-gp activities will be correlated with blood colchicine concentrations determined at different time points after an oral administration of 1.5 mg over 1 hour under fasting condition.\n\nThe CYP3A4 and P-gp phenotyping will be proposed to all gouty patients who experienced gout flare and who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nParticipants will have 3 visits :\n\nV0: inclusion visit of patients who had untreated gout flare. Signed consent to the study will be collected and blood analysis performed. A blood collection and biobank of serum will be done using the blood harvested for gout care. Colchicine will be initiated at 1.5 mg over 1 hour (1 mg + 0.5 mg)\nV1: treatment efficiency will be assessed 48 h after V0 using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0-100) pain measurement. Patients who will have an improvement of VAS more than 50% of baseline VAS will be considered as responders to colchicine. In contrast an improvement less than 50% of baseline VAS will be considered as non-responders. Gout flare treatment will be adapted according to patient response. Colchicine treatment will be stopped after gout flare resolution\nV2: this visit will be appointed 1 month after V1 (far enough after resolution of gout flare). During this visit, the CYP3A4 and P-gp phenotyping will be performed. Patients will receive colchicine (1.5 mg over 1 hour) and midazolam (1 mg) and fexofenadine (120 mg) orally. A kinetic of blood samples will be harvested with a total of 8 time points from T0 prior to drug administration to T6 6 hour post-drug administration. At the end of the phenotyping kinetic, urate-lowering therapy will be introduced according to usual care and dosage. This visit is the last visit of the protocol and patients will be followed-up as usual care.\n\nPlasma concentrations of colchicine, midazolam, hydroxymidazolam and fexofenadine will be quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (PMID 24295116).\n\nPlasma concentrations of colchicine will then correlate to CYP3A4 and P-gp activities estimated by midazolam and fexofenadine metabolism, respectively.\n\nThe phenotyping will be performed in 34 colchicine responder and 34 colchicine non-responder patients.	2019-09-10	2019-10-10	2022-04-01	2019-05-01	\N	2021-11-22	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Gout Flare"}	combination	fexofenadine	In this study fexofenadine is only used to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of colchicine: “The individual CYP3A4 and P-gp activities can be assessed with specific probe and/or substrate of these proteins in the so-called phenotyping assay.

Of those patients up to 60% may have an inadequate response to proton pump inhibitors and have persistent symptoms. One possible explanation is that this group of patients has nerve related pain. It is thought that H1 receptor activation may sensitize the gastrointestinal tract and esophagus to pain. H1 blockers such as anti-histamines may play a role in treatment of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms that are refractory to proton pump inhibitors by reducing pain perception. The investigators wish to conduct a randomized control trial to test this hypothesis.

It is a polygenetic condition with variable degree of severity, age of onset, and location of hair loss.\n\nHair loss typically begins with bi-temporal recession of the frontal hairline, followed by diffuse hair thinning at the vertex, and eventual complete loss of hair at the center of the vertex. The bald patch at the vertex subsequently joins the frontal receding hairline, leaving an island of hair on the frontal scalp, which finally disappears leaving hair only in the parietal and occipital zones producing the characteristic "horseshoe" pattern.\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia is classified according to the Hamilton-Norwood scale into grades (from I to VII).\n\nAGA features a progressive miniaturization of the hair follicle leading to vellus transformation of terminal hair which results from an alteration in hair cycle dynamics: anagen phase duration gradually decreases and that of the telogen phase increases. As the anagen phase duration determines hair length, the new anagen hair becomes shorter, eventually leading to bald appearance.\n\nThe etiology of AGA is multifactorial and polygenetic. Male AGA (MAGA) is clearly an androgen-dependent condition and, although the mode of inheritance is uncertain, a genetic predisposition is observed, while in female AGA (FAGA) the role of androgens is still uncertain.\n\nRegarding treatment of AGA; in most cases it's challenging and unsatisfactory. Finasteride and Minoxidil 2-5 % solution are the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment options for MAGA.\n\nFinasteride is a type 2 5α-reductase inhibitor that decreases the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is responsible for the miniaturization of the hair follicle seen in MAGA.\n\nMinoxidil is a direct arteriolar vasodilator acts by opening potassium channels. Unwanted hair growth was observed as an adverse effect in 24-100 % of patients treated by Minoxidil for hypertension. Minoxidil 2 % solution was approved in 1988, while the 5 % solution was approved in 1991, and the 5 % foam in 2016 for MAGA.\n\nOn the basis of hypertrichosis observed in patients treated with analogues of prostaglandin PGF2a (i.e. latanoprost used for glaucoma), it was supposed that prostaglandins would have an important role in the hair growth.\n\nTheir action is variable depending on the class they belong to: PGE and PGF2a play a generally positive role on the hair growth, while PGD2 an inhibitory role on the hair growth.\n\nMultiple studies had claimed that prostaglandins are deregulated in both alopecia areata (AA) and AGA.\n\nGarza in 2012 found elevated levels of prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) at the mRNA and protein levels in bald scalp versus haired scalp of men with AGA. Also found that the enzymatic product of PTGDS and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) are raised in bald human scalp tissue. These results implicate that PGD2 might has a role in pathogenesis of AGA, thus suggest new receptor targets for its treatment.\n\nCetirizine, the active carboxylic acid metabolite of hydroxyzine, is a safe and selective second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist widely used in daily practice. It has anti-inflammatory properties and high specific affinity for histamine H1 receptors. Studies have shown cetirizine causes a significant reduction in both the inflammatory cell infiltrate and PGD2 production, and these effects are not related to its anti-H1 activity.\n\nThe oral administration of cetirizine is commonly leads to different systemic side effects as sedation, ocular dryness, tiredness and dry mouth.

Blinding of the principal investigator and co-investigators will be safeguarded by blinding the identity of the study articles (LTZ 0.5 mg/ml oral solution or placebo solution similar in color, flavoring and consistency) and preventing access to specific source documents that will be used for recording of collected blood samples until the time of data analysis.	\N	Treatment	\N	The investigator hypothesizes that children with a hyper-responsive HILD (Histamine Lontophoresis with Laser Doppler monitoring) response type are more likely to have improved asthma control after the addition of the antihistamine LTZ (Levocetirizine) to standard asthma regimen in comparison to children with hypo-responsive HILD type. This study will provide a model for a functional biomarker to inform decision making for therapeutics in children. This work is novel in testing and validating a biomarker accurately and predicting response to asthma treatment in children. This work is significant because it has the potential to alter the current treatment paradigms for children with asthma where response to treatment is predicted a priority. The proposed research will be immediately relevant by expanding knowledge in the field of asthma therapeutics by linking biologically and mechanistically based approaches to an effective and inexpensive treatment for asthma. The primary objective is to determine HILD prediction of therapeutic response in males and females 6-17 years old who identify as African American/Black and Caucasian/White to an antihistamine among children with allergic asthma, and the secondary objective is to develop a robust predictive model of therapeutic response to an antihistamine among children with allergic asthma. There will be 300 participants for approximately 17 weeks.\n\nThe primary outcome measure of therapeutic response to antihistamine will be determined by change in asthma control as guidelines recognize asthma control as a major goal of therapy. Asthma control will be determined based on the Asthma Control Test (ACT®) (children ≥ 12 years of age) or the Child-Asthma Control Test (C-ACT®) (children <12 years of age), validated measures to assess asthma control in children. Children with an ACT or C-ACT score <19 will be classified as having uncontrolled asthma. Assessments will occur at screening, visit 2, 3 and 4 (4 weeks and 6 weeks after the participant is started on drug/placebo.) The secondary measures will include assessment of asthma impairment, risk, and quality of life. These assessments will occur at baseline/pre-dose, 4 weeks after starting drug/placebo, and 6 weeks after drug/placebo for both the LTZ and placebo arms.\n\nThe study team is utilizing HILD a surrogate marker of histamine response and will determine if HILD can predict which participants have improvement in asthma control after treatment with Levocetirizine.	2021-04-28	2025-10-01	2025-10-01	2021-01-07	\N	2022-04-28	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Child}	{"Phase 3"}	{"Allergic Asthma"}	main	levocetirizine	\N	t	Asthma	2022-09-15 18:58:14	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	levocetirizine

Parallel Assignment	Cairo University	OTHER	Female	50	20	66	Actual	OTHER	Cairo University	Randomized	\N	Triple	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of alopecia in men and women. It is a hereditary, androgen-dependent, progressive thinning of scalp hair that follows a defined pattern. The disease mechanism is still relatively poorly understood, but involves a strong genetic contribution as well as some environmental input. AGA manifests as a noticeable reduction of scalp hair coverage, shorter miniaturized telogen vellus hair follicles, and significantly slower rates of hair growth. Approximately 6% to 38% of healthy women experience some degree of frontal and frontoparietal hair loss. AGA may have significant impact on quality of life in female patients. When female AGA is associated with high levels of androgens, systemic antiandrogenic therapy may be needed. However, treating it with oral antiandrogens is usually ineffective suggesting that most female AGA cases are not systemic androgen dependent and topical treatment may be more appropriate.\n\nCurrently, the only clinically validated and licensed medication approved for increasing hair density in women with AGA is 2 % minoxidil topical solution, and up to 5% minoxidil in several countries. The collective effects of minoxidil lead to increased cutaneous blood flow, prolongation of the anagen growth phase, and increase in the size of smaller hair follicles. However, it produces moderate results, and must continue to be used to have a continued benefit, and may produce adverse side effects. The use of higher concentrations of minoxidil in women is supported by results from an early study suggesting that concentrations higher than 2% could improve efficacy without increasing the rates of adverse events when applying not more than 60 mg of minoxidil per day.\n\nBased on the hypertrichosis observed in patients treated with analogues of prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a) (i.e. latanoprost used for glaucoma), it was supposed that prostaglandins would have an important role in hair growth. Their action is variable depending on the class they belong to: prostaglandin E(PGE) and PGF2a play a generally positive role on the hair growth, while PGD2 has an inhibitory role on the hair growth. Elevated levels of prostaglandin D2 synthase (PGDS) were found at the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels in bald scalp versus haired scalp of men with AGA; as well as the enzymatic product of PGDS, (PGD2), is generally elevated in bald human scalp tissue.\n\nCetirizine is a safe and selective, second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist, widely used in daily practice. A study showed that cetirizine causes a significant reduction in both the inflammatory cell infiltrate and PGD2 production. However, these effects apparently are not related to its anti-H1 activity. A pilot study on topical cetirizine showed that cetirizine increased total hair density, terminal hair density and diameter. Also, its lower potential side effects if compared with other drugs commonly used for AGA, as minoxidil (which often cause of hypertrichosis, contact allergic dermatitis, headache and hypotension), can promote a wider use and better compliance of cetirizine in the future for the treatment of AGA. Combinations of therapies are likely to be more efficacious than single treatments.\n\nTreatments to clinically improve scalp hair density and reduce mid-pattern thinning leading to improved scalp coverage are highly important for the affected women. On the basis of the above evidence and lacking studies that confirm the effectiveness of cetirizine in AGA treatment, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topical cetirizine in female patients with AGA.	2020-07-25	2021-11-30	2022-03-31	2020-07-22	\N	2022-03-08	\N	Cairo University	Samar Farghali Farid	Head and professor of clinical pharmacy department	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 2","Phase 3"}	{"Androgenetic Alopecia"}	main	cetirizine	\N	t	Alopecia	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Jaworsky C, Kligman AM, Murphy GF.

Double	\N	\N	Prevention	\N	Significant heat strain where temperatures approach and exceed 39.0 degrees celsius is known to increase intestinal permeability and induce a graded systemic inflammatory response which includes increases in interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and c-reactive protein. Recent data examining firefighters found fire service instructors possessed greater resting levels of inflammatory markers and that 18-29% of the variation in these markers could be explained by frequency of heat strain. Firefighters themselves are susceptible to core temperatures ranging between 38.5 and 39.0C in as little as 2-3 work cycles. Considering resource limitation in the fire service, such workloads is a realistic possibility when at structural fires, particularly for first alarm apparatus.\n\nThough there is a well-defined role of the inflammatory response in adaptive changes, elevated resting levels begs the question of whether such frequency of exposure and acute inflammatory flux in fire service workers may contribute to chronic elevations of inflammatory markers and altered disease risk. Elevations in c-reactive protein are associated with cardiovascular risk with studies indicating a causative role of monomeric c-reactive protein in platelet activation and thrombus growth.\n\nCooling methods save for cryotherapy have demonstrated limited to mild effectiveness for mitigating the inflammatory responses to heat strain resulting in no solution to attenuate acute inflammatory responses. The mast-cell stabilizing properties of desloratadine and its safety profile make it an interesting candidate for investigating its use in this context.\n\nThis study seeks to determine whether 10mg desloratadine taken before and 24h after exertional heat strain to a core temperature to a core temperature of 39.5 degrees celsius reduces the associated inflammatory response measured over a 72-hour period.	2022-07-01	2023-08-01	2023-08-01	2022-07-06	\N	2022-07-06	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Not Applicable"}	{"Heat Stress, Exertional","Inflammatory Response","Firefighter Personal Protective Equipment"}	main	desloratadine	\N	t	Heat Stress	2022-09-15 19:16:20	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	desloratadine

Eligible patients will be randomly and divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Group A will receive fexofenadine 180 mg once daily in addition to standard of care treatment. Group B will receive placebo in addition to standard of care treatment. The routine standard of care treatment will consist of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nThe primary outcomes of the study are the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) urinary symptom score and pain score. Secondary outcomes include (i) number of office phone calls due to urinary symptoms; (ii) duration of analgesic use; (iii) duration and quantity of narcotic use; (iv) number of emergency department visits; (v) drug-related adverse effects; (vi) other domains of the USSQ.

These stents are routinely utilized after urologic procedures for the treatment of urolithiasis and are generally kept in place for 1-2 weeks following the procedure. Despite their advantages, indwelling ureteral stents cause discomfort and reduce patient quality of life. These symptoms are partially attributed to local irritation to the ureter and bladder. Bothersome stent-related symptoms include urinary urgency, frequency, flank pain, hematuria, dysuria, sexual side effects, and emotional distress. The majority of patients with ureteral stents experience symptoms post-operatively.\n\nSeveral studies have indicated that agents such as antimuscarinics or alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists may improve stent-related symptoms. The indications for anticholinergic medications are based on blocking involuntary bladder muscle contraction; however, the efficacy of these drugs is still controversial. Furthermore, these medications have potential adverse side effects.\n\nAntihistamines also show potential in alleviating stent-related symptoms. Multiple in vitro studies have shown H1 receptor activity involved both in ureteral peristalsis and in bladder contraction. Both first- and second-generation H1 antagonists have shown activity in the urinary tract. In clinical practice, antihistamines are commonly utilized in the management of bladder pain caused by interstitial cystitis. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial found efficacy of antihistamines for pain management in the setting of renal colic from obstructing ureteral stones. There is novel evidence that in patients with indwelling stents, there are inflammatory changes in the bladder with an associated eosinophilic reaction. Eosinophilic cystitis is commonly associated with bladder irritation or allergy, and these findings point to a novel paradigm of treating patients with antihistamines. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of antihistamines for managing stent-related symptoms.	2021-06-29	2022-03-01	2022-03-01	2021-01-27	\N	2021-07-20	\N	Columbia University	Ojas Shah	George F.

The risk of stone disease ranges between 5% and 12% worldwide. Ureteric stones account for ≈20% of all urinary tract stones and >70% of the ureteric stones are located in the lower third of the ureter, i.e., distal ureteric stones (DUS). The colicky-type pain in the ureter, an increase in proximal peristalsis through activation of intrinsic ureteral pacemakers may contribute to the perception of pain. Muscle spasm increased proximal peristalsis, local inflammation, irritation, and oedema at the site of obstruction may contribute to the development of pain through chemoreceptor activation and stretching of submucosal free nerve endings. α-adrenergic blockers, anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistaminic and calcium channel blockers, which have a relaxant effect on the ureteric smooth musculature. The presence of histamine receptors in the ureter have been presented in various studies. The histamine-1 (H1) receptors have been shown to have a wide distribution Histamine, which is secreted from the mast cells, causes strong peristaltic contractions in the ureter. alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists (i.e., tamsulosin) have been employed in the treatment of ureteric colic due to smooth muscle relaxation so their potential ability to increase stone passage, reduce pain medication use and reduce urologic interventions. According to the currently accepted view, renal colic management starts with NSAI drugs also NSAI has role in decrease inflammation and oedema and increase expulsion rate . in this study we will compare the use of alpha blocker versus alpha blocker and antihistaminic in management of acute renal colic prevent pain recurrence and increase expulsion rate of ureteric stone ≤ 1cm, with analgesic use in case of acute stage.	\N	Assiut University	OTHER	All	85	18	100	Anticipated	OTHER	Assiut University	\N	\N	\N	\N	Other	\N	Prospective	All the patients will be included within inclusion criteria After providing written informed consent, these patients were randomly divided into 2 groups by use of a computer-generated random number table.\n\nhistory taken about patient pain onset, duration and type with scoring the pain by World Health Organization numerical pain score of 0-10.\nUltrasonography done to determine if kidney obstructed and grade of obstruction at the day 1 day 15 and day 30.\ngroup A receive Tamsulosin 0.4mg in combination of NSAI drug if patient present with colic, if not in renal colic at bed time Tamsulosin 0.4mg with analgesic on demand, group B receive pheniramine maleate 50mg injection every 12hr for 24 hr in combination of Tamsulosin 0.4mg and NSAI drug then fexofenadine 180 mg in combination of Tamsulosin 0.4mg and NSAI drug on demand if patient present with colic. if not in renal colic at bed time fexofenadine 180 mg in combination of Tamsulosin with NSAI on demand.\nIn case of patient presented by acute renal colic the time of administration of treatment recorded and the time of relief pain recorded.\nCT scan done to ensure urolithiases if no CT done at the first day and after 30 days.\nFull labs done especially serum creatinine and serum uric acid.	2021-11-30	2022-11-25	2022-11-25	2021-12-09	\N	2021-12-09	\N	Assiut University	Mostafa Kamel Abdel Rahman	Director	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Observational	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{}	{"Renal Colic","Ureter Stone"}	combination	fexofenadine	\N	t	Nephrolithiasis	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{"Bader MJ, Eisner B, Porpiglia F, Preminger GM, Tiselius HG.

Transporters for Organic Cations and Glycemic Control in Patients With Neuropathic Pain.	Completed	This study aimed to investigate the influence of the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and of cetirizine (OCTs inhibitor) on gabapentin kinetics disposition and pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) in patients with neuropathic pain. Thus, non-diabetic patients (Control Group, n=10), patients with controlled diabetes (n=9) and patients with uncontrolled diabetes (n=10), all with neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 in pain visual analog scale (0-10) were investigated.	Parallel Assignment	Natalia Valadares de Moraes	OTHER	All	59	18	29	Actual	OTHER	Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho	Non-Randomized	\N	None (Open Label)	\N	\N	Treatment	\N	Gabapentin (GBP), anticonvulsant used to neuropathic pain treatment, is mainly eliminated unchanged in urine. Renal active tubular secretion has been suggested to contribute on GBP excretion by renal excretion. Studies performed on rats with experimental diabetes suggest that hyperglycemia reduces the activity of organic cation transporters (Oct). Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the role of OCTs on kinetic disposition and pharmacodynamics of GBP in patients with neuropathic pain and to verify the regulation of these transporters' activity by glycemic control in diabetes. A cross-over clinical study was performed in patients with neuropathic pain (n=10, Control) to evaluate the influence of CTZ on GBP kinetic disposition. To evaluate the effect of glycemic control, patients with controlled DM2 (DC, n=9) and uncontrolled DM2 (DNC, n=10) were investigated. All participants investigated had neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 evaluated by analogue visual scale (EVA) and were treated with oral single-dose of 300 mg of GBP (Phase 1) or cetirizine (20 mg/day) for 5 days and single-dose of GBP on the last day (Phase 2). Only participants of Control group participated of Phase 2. Serial blood and urine samples were collected up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The intensity of pain was evaluated at the same time of blood sampling, using the visual analog scale. GBP concentration in plasma and urine was validated by JPLC-UV. All participants were genotyped for polymorphisms SLC22A2 808G>T and SLC22A4 1507C>T. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis.	2015-11-01	2018-05-01	2019-07-01	2017-02-08	\N	2019-07-05	\N	Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho	Natalia Valadares de Moraes	Assistant Professor	\N	\N	Sponsor-Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Neuropathic Pain","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","Diabetic Neuropathy, Painful"}	main	cetirizine	\N	t	Neuropathic Pain	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{}	PUBLISHED	https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcph.1603	cetirizine

Non-motor symptoms like cognitive or sleep-related disorders and disturbed vigilance, however, are common in PD and can significantly worsen health and quality of life of the patient and family members. Some of these non-motor symptoms may also be caused by the antiparkinsonian medication per se. The Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) initiated a review of dopamine agonists in relation to episodes of sudden onset of sleep already in 2000 which resulted in special warnings of somnolence and sudden sleep attacks in the non-ergot dopamine agonists' summary of product characteristics.\n\nBeneficial effects of piribedil on parameters of vigilance and cognition have been described in several studies. But, as it seems, no study has been performed so far to identify such effects in the setting of a comparative study with different oral non-ergot dopamine agonists in patients with PD, and utilizing vigilance and cognitive parameters as primary and main secondary objective. The neuropsychological tests being applied in this study are validated and routinely used tests in studies investigating different aspects of attention or vigilance and cognition.	2010-01-01	2011-12-01	2011-12-01	2009-11-04	\N	2012-05-24	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 3"}	{"Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease"}	not included	loratadine	Only in exclusion criteria	t	Parkinson	2022-08-17 18:44:47	{}	UNKNOWN	\N	loratadine

The above described study from Takahashi et al, comparing 60 mg twice daily versus cetirizine 10 mg once daily suggests that it is not [4]. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and consistency of action of levocetirizine 5 mg once daily with fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily over a 24 hour period in the histamine induced wheal, flare and itch response. Furthermore, we would like to investigate whether a different between Japanese and Caucasian exists or not. Each volunteer will receive the study medication at time point 0 and 12 hour later. Skin Prick Test (SPT) will be performed in each volunteer using histamine (10 mg/ml), 15 minutes before drug admission (baseline) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours afterwards. Volumetric optical scanning system and infrared camera will be used for objective evaluation of the wheal- and flare reduction. Additionally, measurement of the erythema diameter with a transparent ruler will be performed. The subjective intensity of itching will be assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). To relate the pharmacokinetics of the drugs to their pharmacodynamics, blood samples for assay of drug concentrations will be taken at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours later. Subjects will undergo the same procedure on three separate occasions to receive each treatment option. The options are: placebo at time 0 hours + placebo at 12 hours, Levocetirizine 5mg at time 0 hours + placebo at 12 hours or fexofenadine 60mg at time 0 hours + fexofenadine 60mg at 12 hours. There will be a washout period of at least 6 days between the treatments.	2011-02-01	2011-11-01	2012-02-01	2012-04-26	2019-10-04	2019-10-04	University of Charité Berlin; Dpt. of Dermatology and Allergy	Charite University, Berlin, Germany	Martin Metz	Prof. Dr. med.	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 4"}	{Pruritus,"Chronic Urticaria","Allergic Rhinitis"}	comparison	fexofenadine	check usecase again	f	Safety Evaluation	2022-08-18 16:54:53	{"Schoepke N, Church MK, Maurer M.

He advocates treatment with first generation hydroxyzine, which he considers at least as effective as modern second generation H1-blockers in suppressing the symptoms of difficult-to-treat / systemic-steroid-dependant cases of chronic urticaria. He further speculates that hydroxyzine may have the advantage to better suppress itch and improve nighttime sleep. This has prompted many practitioners around the world to believe that adding hydroxyzine to the treatment regimen at bed time at night may be beneficial to patients. At the same time European guidelines indicate modern second generation H1-blockers in higher than conventional doses as drugs of choice for such cases. However, there is no evidence from clinical trials addressing this controversy. The investigators' previous studies suggest that levocetirizine at quadruple doses may be beneficial in difficult to treat urticaria by reducing lesions and itch, improving quality of life and night time sleep, while not causing day time somnolence. First generation H1-receptor antagonists and hydroxyzine among them are known to penetrate the blood / brain barrier and to cause sedation. The question stays whether this sedation is beneficial to the subjects with chronic urticaria at night, whether it has any hang-over unwanted effects the following day and whether this has any influence on the overall urticaria-specific quality of life.

Hospitalized patients will be invited to take part in the study and will sign an informed consent. They will be assessed by standard questionnaire and by objective assessment of the urticarial lesions, QoLQ will be filled in, discomfort due to urticaria, day time somnolence and night time sleep quality will be assessed on a visual analogue scale. Systemic steroids will be withheld and patients would be given 10 mg levocetirizine on Days 1 & 2; after a new assessment of quality of night time sleep and day time somnolence, 100 mg hydroxyzine will be given on Days 3 & 4. The cycle will be repeated on Days 5 & 6 and Days 7 & 8 with 20 mg levocetirizine and 200 hydroxyzine respectively. At this point patients will be discharged and randomized to two treatment arms: levocetirizine 20 mg per day and levocetirizine 15 mg + hydroxyzine 50 mg as evening dose for 5 days. Diaries will be given to patients for assessment of daily SS, day time somnolence score, quality of night time sleep, facial tissue swelling, rescue medication with oral prednisolone, adverse events, intake of any other medications. After 5 days the patients from arm 1 and 2 will be crossed over to the alternative treatment. QoLQ questionnaire will be filled out at onset, at cross over (day 5) and at the end of the 10 day treatment period. On completion of the study subjects will be asked to state there preference for one treatment or the other.	2011-03-01	2013-02-01	2013-03-01	2010-12-01	\N	2013-07-17	\N	Association Asthma, Bulgaria	Prof. Todor Popov	Prof. Todor Popov	\N	\N	Principal Investigator	\N	Interventional	{Adult,"Older Adult"}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Chronic Urticaria"}	comparison	cetirizine	\N	f	Urticaria	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{"Kaplan AP.

The TSSC score was expressed as the sum of the 4 individual symptoms scores recorded in the daily diary cards for the following symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes.\n\nSubjects were randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments in a double-blind fashion using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio: cetirizine HCl syrup and placebo loratadine syrup; loratadine syrup and placebo cetirizine HCl syrup; or cetirizine placebo syrup and loratadine placebo syrup.\n\nNumber of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): 1100 planned; 1536 screened; 683 randomized: 231 (33.8%) randomized to the cetirizine HCl treatment group, 221 (32.4%) to the loratadine treatment group, and 231 (33.8%) to the placebo treatment group.\n\nTest Product and Reference Therapy: Subjects randomized to receive cetirizine HCl syrup also received placebo syrup; subjects randomized to receive loratadine syrup also received placebo syrup; and both placebo syrups were received by subjects randomized to receive placebo.\n\nDuration of Double-Blind Treatment: 2 weeks.\n\nSafety measures included the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), vital signs, concomitant medications, and physical examination findings. Clinical laboratory evaluation was not required for this study.\n\nStatistical Methods: All statistical tests related to treatment effect were 2-sided, and statistical significance was declared at the 0.05 probability level. Least squares means (LSMeans) were used to estimate treatment effect. Populations analyzed included the Full Analysis (intent-to-treat [ITT]) Set (FAS), Per-Protocol Set (PPS), Safety-Analyzable Set, and All-Screened Analysis Set. Demographic and baseline data for all subjects in the Safety-Analyzable Set were summarized and listed. The effects of treatment at the Overall and all other analysis Time Points were assessed using ANCOVA models. The main effects model contained terms for treatment and Investigator site, with baseline TSSC value as a covariate. The LSMeans and standard errors were based on the main effects model. Methods of analysis of secondary efficacy data included analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) row mean scores tests. Analysis of drug safety included the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE), concomitant medications, vital signs, and physical examination findings for the Safety-Analyzable Set.	2001-03-01	2001-07-01	2001-07-01	2016-10-13	\N	2017-04-20	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sponsor	\N	Interventional	{Child}	{"Phase 4"}	{"Allergic Rhinitis","Hay Fever",SAR,"Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}	comparison	cetirizine	\N	f	Allergic Rhinitis	2022-08-17 13:39:16	{}	NO_PUBLICATION_FOUND	\N	cetirizine|loratadine

Therapeutic strategies also target a reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators released from activated cells, including mast cells and epithelial cells. The presence of allergic inflammation in nasal mucosa may increase the risk of asthma occurrence, especially in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis. H1 antihistamines are widely recommended in all types of allergic rhinitis, regardless of symptom severity or persistence. They control all of the symptoms, but to a lesser extent nasal congestion. New generation agents, such as levocetirizine and desloratadine, possess anti-inflammatory properties, reducing allergic inflammation.

Patients took desloratadine for 1 month. Once a week, patients filled out a questionnaire to tell how their hives affected their lives. This questionnaire is called the Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI. They also filled out a diary every day to tell how much itching they had, how many hives they had, and how their hives had affected their sleep or daily activities. The patients and doctors rated the patients' overall condition and how much relief patients got from treatment.

The lotion is applied to the subject on back and front of the trunk, both hands (palm and back) and both arms. An SOP for handling and application of the lotion ensures the 11 grams covers 54% of the body surface area (BSA) evenly without residue.\n\nComment:\n\nThe treatment is single-dose and single-treatment. The FTU is used to standardize the amount of cream being applied in clinical research. It is also used in clinical practice and hence connects the objectiveness of the trial to the clinical situation.
